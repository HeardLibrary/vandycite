Pentecost was an event that not only harkened back to the dramatic events of the giving of the law at Sinai and the presence of God for the prophets, but also centred in God's self-disclosure in the Incarnation, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  The Pentecost theophany not only inaugurates the kingdom, but also looks forward to the final theophany of God in the parousia, when the Lord comes in judgement with signs of blood, fire and smoke (Acts 2:19-20). Tongues, like the kairos event of the Pentecost theophany, is a vehicle of divine self-disclosure that transforms language and hints at the future transformation of the world.""
