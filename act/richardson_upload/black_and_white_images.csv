The synoptic command to love one's neighbor is vague and ambiguous, and only John ventures so far as to give specifics.  For the Johannine author, love is defined in terms of Christly imitation and self-sacrifice...In understanding what it means to love one another, Jesus presents himself as a model.  We should love others as Jesus loves us.  A simple enough command, to be sure, except that to love as Jesus does means self-sacrifice and death."" (Moss, 49)  Note: Candida R.
