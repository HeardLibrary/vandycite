When Jonah complains, God criticizes him for being more concerned with his own comfort than with the inhabitants of the huge city of Nineveh.  Jonah is an excellent example of someone who really does not take his relationship with God that seriously , but despite this is very effective in doing what God wants him to do.""

There are others where the representation of cowardice or of betrayal rouses our pity for its victim and our reprobation for the act itself.  But the sleep of the apostles at Gethsemane, not wanting to accompany the Word in his fight to give his word to the very end, could not be for us a foreign event that we would consider with detachment or scandal.  It concerns our evasion, our withdrawal, our sleep.  We see ourselves sleeping when we should be awake.  This sleep has something terrible about it, in that we know it to be and recognize it as our own. "" (Chretien, 66) <p><p>Donated by James T.

The synoptic command to love one's neighbor is vague and ambiguous, and only John ventures so far as to give specifics.  For the Johannine author, love is defined in terms of Christly imitation and self-sacrifice...In understanding what it means to love one another, Jesus presents himself as a model.  We should love others as Jesus loves us.  A simple enough command, to be sure, except that to love as Jesus does means self-sacrifice and death."" (Moss, 49)  Note: Candida R.

On the right, the artist has chosen to represent the marriage consumation and births that follow with bedsheets. ""In a narrative that should be understood as an historical account, Hosea records the names of his wife and children and the symbolic warnings that were intended for the wayward nation.  Fully aware of the kind of woman that God wanted him to marry, Hosea announces in verse 3 that he has married Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim.  Knowing that the name Gomer comes from a verb root meaning ""to end, to come to an end, to complete,"" Keil has suggested that the woman's name indicates that she would be brought tom ""completion"" or ""perfection"" through her whoredom.

And he gave to Mary also to drink, and sent her away to the hill-country; and she returned unhurt. And all the people wondered that sin did not appear in them. And the priest said: If the Lord God has not made manifest your sins, neither do I judge you. And he sent them away. And Joseph took Mary, and went away to his own house, rejoicing and glorifying the God of Israel.""

42491,2D,2022-06-20 19:27:24.0,2004-11-05 00:00:00.0,France,Other,"Art historian Maria Kupfer, in an article in the Art Bulletin, March 1986, forms the theory that this part of the fresco cycle inside the church at Nohant-Vic represents the sixth chapter of Isaiah.  The pertinent verses say, ""6:6 Then one of the seraphs flew to me, holding a live coal that had been taken from the altar with a pair of tongs.6:7 The seraph touched my mouth with it and said: ""Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt has departed and your sin is blotted out."" ""<br><br>This image could also represent the action in the first chapter of Jeremiah, when Jeremiah's mission was initiated by the Lord putting words into his mouth.  <br><br>Another possibility is that, since much of the decoration cycle in the small church includes images of the tetramorph (Ezekiel 1:10) and the wheel (Ezekiel 1:19; 10:9-14), key iconographic elements associated with Ezekiel, then perhaps this image represents Ezekiel 1:9, in which God touches Ezekiel's mouth to put God's words into it.  The eating of the scroll is the initiation of Ezekiel's call to be a prophet to Israel, a typological symbol for Christ's prophetic life.  The fresco iconography also underscores the presaging of the Eucharist. This fresco is immediately before the scene of Christ's entry into Jerusalem, the first scene of the Passion Cycle on the walls that follow. <p><p>Donated by James T.

The Romans decorated their large but portable burial boxes, or sarcophagi, with deeply incised relief sculpture. This sarcophagus, now in the Vatican Museum, is an example of the type of early Christian relief sculpture that emphasizes Christ's Entry into Jerusalem; the depiction of the Entry is often accompanied by scenes of Christ's healing of the sick. This illustration shows the central portion of this sarcophagus.</p><p>""In the middle comes a double register with two scenes divided by a horizontal bar.  Below lies the paralyzed man, whether of Bethesda or Capernaum; above, he bears his bed away on his back at Christ's command, while the bystanders raise their hands in amazement.  Then, on the right, Christ is shown, like some victorious emperor, riding in to Jerusalem triumphantly, on the donkey. </p><p> The artist has been concerned to bring out as many details of the Biblical narrative as possible in the confined space.  One man solemnly raises his hand as if to say, ""Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord'; others clasp branches which they have ""cut from the trees"" while others again ""spread their garments in the way"". At the end an apostle holds the conqueror's garland in readiness. This type of Bethesda sarcophagus, with its crowded and confused middle section, was quite widely copied and is found as far away as Spain.""</p><p>[Quoted text from: <em>Early Christian Art and Architecture</em> by Robert Milburn, 1991. pg. 73]</p> <p><p>Donated by Robert Womack and Anne Richardson, Nashville, TN.</p>",en,||||,image donated by Jim Womack and Anne Richardson,135,,3rd-4th centuries,||||,CPalm|BPalm,Educational Use Permitted,,Mark 11:1-11|John 12:12-16|Luke 19:28-40,Vatican City.

In 1971, Trinity was designated a National Historic Landmark for ""possessing ""exceptional value in commemorating or illustrating the history of the United States."" The peacock has a long history in Roman and Christian tradition. This low-relief sculpture panel in a chapel area of Trinity Church, Boston, shows a pair of peacocks among fruit, vines, and branches. The pair of peacocks, symmetrically opposite, are drinking from the fruit of the vine, the source of eternal life. This eucharistic gesture gave meaning throughout its use in Christian history, since the peacock was considered a symbol of the divine, incorruptible and Christ-like in that purity. Salvation, resurrection, and immortality are meanings assigned to the peacock.

This scene shows Jesus teaching his disciples, while the crowd outside listens attentively.  The beauty of the oak woodcarvings that adorn the otherwise simple seating for clerics is world renowned.  <p>The 19th century author and medieval art enthusiast, John Ruskin, wrote an essay on the cathedral of Amiens, ""The Bible of Amiens.""  Ruskin's Christian faith and his appreciation for religious art went hand in hand, and his appreciation of the deeply moving relief sculpture in the wooden choirstalls inspired him to write write the following: </p><p>""Sweet and young-grained wood it is: oak, trained and chosen for such work, sound now as four hundred years since.  Under the carver's hand it seems to cut like clay, to fold like silk, to grow like living branches, to leap like living flame,...and it shoots and wreathes itself into an enchanted glade, inextricable, imperishable, fuller of leafage than any forest, and fuller of story than any book.""

Pentecost was an event that not only harkened back to the dramatic events of the giving of the law at Sinai and the presence of God for the prophets, but also centred in God's self-disclosure in the Incarnation, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  The Pentecost theophany not only inaugurates the kingdom, but also looks forward to the final theophany of God in the parousia, when the Lord comes in judgement with signs of blood, fire and smoke (Acts 2:19-20). Tongues, like the kairos event of the Pentecost theophany, is a vehicle of divine self-disclosure that transforms language and hints at the future transformation of the world.""

53846,3D,2022-06-19 15:54:39.0,2008-02-03 12:46:07.0,Italy,Other,"The artist of the Rabbula Gospels illustrated more scenes from the book of Acts than from the Gospels, including this Ascension scene that includes symbols associated with Ezekiel (wheels, tetramorph) and a small, brown hand of God. In this Gospel/Acts book is also the first known instance of the presence of Mary, the mother of Jesus, with the disciples at Pentecost. ""The Rabbula Gospels, or Rabula Gospels, (Florence, Biblioteca Mediceo Laurenziana, cod. Plut. I, 56) is a 6th century illuminated Syriac Gospel Book. One of the finest Byzantine works produced in Asia, and one of the earliest Christian manuscripts with large miniatures, it is distinguished by the miniaturist's predilection for bright colours, movement, drama, and expressionism.The [Rabbula] Gospel was completed in 586 at Monastery of St. John of Zagba which, although traditionally thought to have been in Northern Mesopotamia, is now thought to have been in the hinterland between Antioch and Apamea. It was signed by its scribe, Rabbula, about whom nothing else is known. The text is the Peshitta version of the Syriac translation of the Gospels...The scene of the Crucifixion is the earliest to survive in an illuminated manuscript, and shows the Eastern form of the image at the time. There is a miniature of the Apostles choosing a new twelfth member (after the loss of Judas); this is not an event found in the Canonical Gospels (though it is mentioned in Chapter 1 of Acts) and is almost never seen in later art. The artist was trained in the classical illusionist tradition, and is a competent and practiced hand rather than an outstanding talent; but surviving images from this period are so rare that his are extremely valuable for showing the style and iconography of his age.""

He was the patron saint of several professions, locales, and kingdoms. He was also a highly revered saint in the Coptic Orthodox Church as Maurice was a Black Christian from Thebes, Egypt.

Van Dyck was chiefly concerned with the lesson of North Italian panters, above all Titian, whose example helped form th epoetic and elegant style of the religious pictures, mythologies, and portraits he painted later in Antwerp and in England.  This painting was probably executed in Antwerp shortly after his return from Italy, and reveals his study of Titian and also of Correggio and Parmigianino.</p><p><em>A Virgina and Child with Saint Catherine</em> by Van Dyck was sent to Charles I of England as a New Year's gift in 1632 and another was sent to Holland at the same time.  It has been suggested that the present picture was one of these two paintings.

Pentecost was an event that not only harkened back to the dramatic events of the giving of the law at Sinai and the presence of God for the prophets, but also centred in God's self-disclosure in the Incarnation, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ.  The Pentecost theophany not only inaugurates the kingdom, but also looks forward to the final theophany of God in the parousia, when the Lord comes in judgement with signs of blood, fire and smoke (Acts 2:19-20). Tongues, like the kairos event of the Pentecost theophany, is a vehicle of divine self-disclosure that transforms language and hints at the future transformation of the world.""
