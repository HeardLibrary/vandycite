<li>Late 3rd century</li>
</ul>
<p>""The First Apology"" by St. Justin Martyr, an early Christian, quotes Psalm 19:5-6, a verse that was very popular with early Christians. It was associated with the ancient Christian custom of praying toward the East, the direction of Christ's Ascension and second coming, instead of toward Jerusalem as Jews did: 
</p>
<p>""And hear how it was foretold concerning those who published His doctrine and proclaimed His appearance, the above-mentioned prophet and king [David] speaking thus by the Spirit of prophecy. ""....In the sun has He set His tabernacle, and he as a bridegroom going out of his chamber shall rejoice as a giant to run his course.""
</p>
<p>Christ was also associated with ""the Sun of justice with its healing rays"", a Messianic image from Malachi 3:20.
</p>
From ""THE BONES OF ST. PETER : The First Full Account of the Search for the Apostle's Body (Doubleday, 1982) by John Evangelist Walsh""; plate 7 shows a larger black-and-white image; p.26 says that three other mosaics in the tomb on the walls show (a) Jonah falling from a ship and being swallowed by the whale, (b) a fisherman standing on rocks fishing (c) the good shepherd with a sheep across his shoulders. The mosaic on the dome comes half-way down the walls. The rays of light ""strongly suggest the form of a cross."" The tomb was decorated about 250 with these motifs.  The damage to the mosaic on the left is in fact a hole in the centre of the ceiling.  The tomb was accessed from the street of pagan Roman tombs, and the access covered by a slab.  When this was lifted, the hole in the middle of the dome was accessible.  The tomb is described, not as a papal tomb, but as the ""tomb of the golden mosaic.""  Originally it contained a pagan burial of a child and no adornment.  Around 250 the family had converted to Christianity, and redecorated it.  Three Christian burials were located under the floor.  A story from 1574 relates how workmen had opened ""a tomb with golden mosaics and two white horses"", and found a body on a slab on the floor covered with quicklime; the body was not present when the tomb was located again during the 1941 excavations.",,,"[""CC-PD-Mark"", ""Christian catacombs"", ""Halo (religious iconography)"", ""Mosaics in Rome"", ""Mosaics of Jesus Christ"", ""PD-Art (PD-old-70)"", ""PD-Art (PD-old default)"", ""People with horses in art"", ""Psalm 19"", ""Rearing horses in art"", ""Sol Invictus"", ""Syncretism"", ""Vatican Necropolis""]","[""ChristAsSol""]"

It is located in the White Bay, which is dedicated to Henry White.  White was an American diplomat and peace-maker who served as a delegate to the Versailles Peace Conference at the end of World War I.  The theme of the bay is ""peace and unit.""  This window was designed by Marguerite Gaudin, and fabricated by Willet Stained Glass Studios.  Note the atom in the lower right corner of the left pane (symbolizing the peaceful uses of nuclear power).  It was dedicated in 1957.
<p>A ""clerestory"" window is one that is high above the floor, and usually is quite narrow.  They are designed to allow light into a cathedral.
</p>
Originally, the cathedral building committee required that all stained glass in the cathedral be the modestly colored English-style stained glass.  Lawrence Saint designed most of the stained glass windows for the chancel, choir, and side chapels. But in the 1950s, financial patron James Sheldon convinced the building committee to abandon that plan in favor of the more vibrant, light-filled style of the French and Spanish cathedrals. This is why the Washington National Cathedral has such vibrant, glowing windows instead of gloomy pastels that let in almost no light.",,,"[""Atoms in art"", ""Flags of Brazil in art"", ""Flickr images reviewed by FlickreviewR"", ""Marguerite Gaudin"", ""Photographs by Tim Evanson"", ""Stained glass windows of the Washington National Cathedral"", ""Union Jack in art""]","[""Clerestory window - North Nave 02 - National Cathedral - DC""]"

Anthony, as Uncle Sam chuckles in background.  The cartoon was created by Charles Lewis Bartholomew and published in the <i>Minneapolis Journal</i> on April 26, 1905.  It was occasioned by an article that Cleveland wrote in the <i>Ladies' Home Journal</i> (in the cartoon Anthony has a copy of a magazine called the <i>Ladies' Home Trouble</i> tucked under her arm) warning that women's clubs were harmful to marriage and declaring that women should honor and care for their husbands.  Anthony wrote a sharp response that was widely reprinted.  In an interview she also reminded people of Cleveland's marriage infidelity and illegitimate child, saying ""I think that Mr. Cleveland is a very poor one to attempt to point out the proper conduct of the women.""
