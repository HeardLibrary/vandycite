Ivanov’s subject is therefore the impending transformation of humankind.” (Neuberger, 88)  The oil sketch of the two slaves is most likely one of the many Ivanov painted over a 20 year period as he developed figures and themes for his masterwork.  Christ’s coming meant freedom to those oppressed by ill health, slavery, and other cultural and social ills, and Ivanov’s long labors to communicate both the spiritual and worldly importance of Christ’s coming resulted in his masterwork. <br><br>From The Yorck Project.",||||,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Alexander_Andrejewitsch_Iwanow_002.jpg,190,,1837-1857,||||,BNYDy|AProp09,Educational Use Permitted,,Matthew 10:24-39|Mark 10:35-45|Galatians 4:4-7|Philippians 2:5-11|Colossians 3:1-11|Zechariah 9:9-12,"Gosudarstvennyĭ russkiĭ muzeĭ (Saint Petersburg, Russia)",Yorck_A_045,,Two Slaves,,||||,Slaves|Prisoners,on,Painting,"Ivanov, Aleksandr Andreevich, 1806-1858",,St. Petersburg,,46A18,,2,1837,4,Please visit the URL in the Copyright Source field on this page for details about reusing this image.

These are not ""moving pictures,"" but posed scenes.  Their purpose is not to arouse emotion, but to stimulate contemplation.  Dominican monks appear in the sacred scenes, both observing and modeling the responses expected from the viewer.  Meditation on these scenes was preparation for preaching vividly and persuasively on them.  ""De modo orandi,"" a thirteenth-century devotional manual for Dominican novices, instructed novices in the use of gestures and postures to accompany and intensify prayer, many of which are also found in the Dominican figures in Fra Angelico's paintings.  The manual states, ""specific states of mystical consciousness can be stimulated by deliberately assuming bodily postures"" (Hood, 1993: 205).  By imitating the founder of the Order, who himself imitated Christ, the novice could begin to preach with his life even before he was permitted to preach with words.""

Two fish symbolize Christ giving two commandments -- love God and love of neighbor.  Venerable Bede adds an interesting moral application for us.  By blessing the loaves, Jesus teaches us to bless our daily bread.  Like the poor barley loaves and little fish, we can offer our poor human qualities to Jesus, who can bless and transform the gift of ourselves for service to others.  Moral strength comes from fellowship wit Jesus who offers us healing power in the frequent reception of the Eucharist.""

Each bay encloses a scene illustrating a text from the Old or New Testament. The theme running through all four scenes is the divine harmony between the prophets' promises and the fulfillment of them as stated in the Apostles' Creed. <p>In the first scene, God the Father raises His hand in benediction before Eve who rises from the sleeping Adam's side. A chorus of angels stands behind the three main figures. In the foreground are a pair of seated figures, each identified by the name inscribed on the scroll held in his hand. The prophet Jeremiah (JEREMIAS) sits at the left holding a scroll inscribed as follows: PATREM INVOCABIMUS QUI TERAM FECIT ET CONDIDIT CELOS(""we shall call upon the Father who made the earth and founded the heavens."") The Apostle Peter sits at the right. The scroll falling over and behind his right leg is inscribed as follows: CREDO IN DEUM PATREM OMNIPOTE TEM CREATOREM CELI ET TERRE [Apostles' Creed] (""I believe in God the Father Almighty, maker of heaven and earth."") <p>In the next section of the tapestry, John the Baptist is shown in the act of baptizing Christ. The upper half of the figure God the Father appears in an aura between two groups: angels and men. The dove of the Holy Spirit descends from the aura toward the figure of Christ standing below. King David, identified by an inscription written accross his robe, holds in his right hand a scroll inscribed with the following words: DOMINUS DIXIT AD ME FILIUS MEUS ES TU (""The Lord said to me, Thou art my son."") Saint Andrew, The Apostle, sits in the lower right corner holding his cross and a small scroll inscribed ANDREAS. A larger scroll rising from his right hand is inscribed as follows: ET IN IHESUM XPRISTUM FILIUM EIUS UNICU DOMIUM NOSTUM [Apostles' Creed] (""And Jesus Christ, His only Son, our Lord."") <p>The third main section of the tapestry shows the Nativity. The Christ Child lies in a pool of light in the center foreground. Joseph and Mary kneel on either side of him, in adoration. Two angels kneel in prayer in the middle distance while a third, holding a scroll inscribed GLORIA IN EXSEXLIS DEO ET IN TER (""Glory to God in the highest and on earth"") appears in the sky before a group of shepherds. In the foreground at the left is the prophet Isaiah, identified by the inscription YSAYAS. His scroll reads: ECCE VIRGO CONCIPIET ET PARIET FILIUM (""Behold the virgin conceived and brought forth a son""). The Apostle James the Elder, identified by an inscription JACOPUS, sits in the lower right corner of this section and holds a scroll with these words: QUI CONCEPTUS EST DE SPIRITU SANCTO NATUS EX MARIA VIRGINE [Apostles' Creed] (""Who was conceived of the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary"") <p>The Crucifixtion is represented in the fourth and final section of the tapestry. The figure of Christ on the cross accupies the center of the space; behind it at left and right the two theives hang on their crosses. Joseph of Arimathea, in the center distance, covers the body of Christ with a cloth. In the foreground, the figures of Mary Magdalene, John the Evangelist, and the swooning Virgin occupy the space at the left of the cross. The prophet Hosea, identified by the inscription OZEAS on his scroll, sits in the lower left corner. The inscription on the major portion of his scroll reads as follows: O MORS ORO MORS TUA MORSUS TUUS ERO INFERNE (""O Death, I shall be your death; I will bite you into destruction, infernal one"") Opposite Hosea, and serving as a pendant to the figure of Jeremiah at the left end of the tapestry, is the seated figure of John, labeled JOHANES. The scroll held in his right hand reads: PASSUS SUB PONCIO PYLATO CRUCIFIXUS MORTUUS ET SEPULT [Apostles' Creed] (""Suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried"")The event represented in each of the four panels expresses the content of each pair of inscriptions.

If we look closely enough, we find that it takes place just before the Passover. John gives us a glimpse into the everyday life Jesus – it is an intimate moment, behind closed doors, meant just for those who are closest to Christ. What John tells us, that the others do not, is that Jesus dipped a bit of food and gave it to Judas.  In first century Palestine, this would have been a sign of deep affection.  It gives us a great insight into what must have taken place between these two men.   For on the one hand Christ, knowing full well what was on the heart of Judas, was showing one final act of love.  In a way, it is a final plea.  He is saying “I know you, I know what you are doing, and you don’t have to go through with it”. He is offering a shred of hope to an otherwise broken and corrupt man.  Judas, at that moment, could have changed his mind.  And while we still have this hope, at the same time we also have a condemnation. In that moment, Jesus and Judas looked eye-to-eye; they were alone in a crowded room, and in Christ’s action of love said, just as loudly as it offered hope: “I know you, I love you, and you have no excuse”. This makes Judas’ betrayal all the more bitter. -- Patrick Darnell<p/>",||||,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:The_Last_Supper_MET_sf32-100-143s1.jpg,,,1500-1530,||||,AHoly03,,,John 13:21-32,Metropolitan Museum of Art,B_WednesdayofHolyWeek,,"Jesus, Judas, and the Others",,||||,Passion of Jesus Christ: Last Supper,on,"Sculpture, freestanding",,,New York,NY,,,2,1500,3,Please visit the URL in the Copyright Source field on this page for details about reusing this image.

Because Vezelay was said to contain the relics of St. Mary of Magdalene, authenticated by Pope Paschal II in the early 12th century, the church became an important pilgrimage site.[1] The artwork for this week's Lectionary reading is one of over 100 sculptures or “capitals” adorning the nave of Vezelay. There is no one unified theme underlying the array of differing episodes on the column sculptures. Although Old Testament scenes predominate, New Testament scenes are present, as well as  astrological symbols, and animals, such as a grasshopper and two pelicans.[2] <p>The scene portrayed depicts Nathan’s rebuke of David from 2 Samuel 11:26-12:13a. As Kirk Ambrose points out, it is not the subject matter of the capitals that should be of primary focus. Rather, the concern is how the scenes would have been perceived and cohered in the minds of medieval viewers.[3] As modern viewers, the visual effects of the sculpture presented in this up-close photograph are not dramatic or well defined. Yet when the sculpture is read as intended for the medieval viewer, a very different effect results. Meaning is not expressed through facial features, as is characteristic of modern sensibility, but is conveyed instead through hand/body gestures. <p> Ambrose states, “Because the Rule of Saint Benedict places a premium on silence…from an early date monks developed alternative modes of communication, including hand signals.”[4] In light of the importance of the artwork's hand gestures, the modern viewer can be led to a deeper understanding of Nathan’s righteous indignation in the face of David’s disgraceful act. Nathan's outstretched hand rebukes David, and David, with fingers turning inward, accepts the realization of his parallel abuse of power for selfish ends. <p> -- [1] Kathryn Morrison, “Ste Madeleine Vezelay” in Jane Turner The Dictionary of Art (Macmillan, New York: 1996) 395.[2] Kathryn Morrison, “Ste Madeleine Vezelay” in Jane Turner, The Dictionary of Art (Macmillan, New York: 1996) 395; Kirk Ambrose, The Nave Sculpture of Vezelay: The Art of Monastic Viewing (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, Canada: 2006), ix.[3] Kirk Ambrose, The Nave Sculpture of Vezelay: The Art of Monastic Viewing (Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, Canada: 2006), xii.[4] Ibid., 19.</p>",||||,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:V%C3%A9zelay_Narthex_Chapiteau_220608_03.jpg,,,ca. 1130,||||,BProp13,,,"Samuel II, 11:26-12:13a",Basilique Sainte-Marie-Madeleine de Vézelay,B_Proper13,,Nathan rebukes David with the parable of the poor man's lamb.,,||||,Adultery,on,Architectural element,,"David, King of Israel (Biblical figure) |Nathan (Biblical figure) ",Vezelay,,,,2,1130,1,Please visit the URL in the Copyright Source field on this page for details about reusing this image.

This illuminated book has been dated around the 6th or early 7th century and is most likely the product of East Byzantine provinces.[1] The Syrian art characterizing this piece is predominantly dependent, then, upon ancient Semitic civilization of Mesopotamia or the Hittite-Aramaic of Syria, but undoubtedly also embodies some Hellenistic and Roman influences.[2] Illustrated by this illumination of the Book of Job, Syrian art possesses the main features of realism, dramatic energy, and inner meaning. David Diringer describes the effects of the narrative, as “being achieved by forceful means.” [3] This is evident in the enlargement of Job to signify importance. <p>When examining the illustration, it is clear the illustrator pulled several points of the story of Job into this one representation. Reflecting on the lectionary text, one can clearly recognize the first moments of pain inflicted on Job revealed in 2:7. The presence of his wife in the lower right quadrant moves the narration to 2:9-10. Correspondingly, the depictions of Job’s three friends continues the story of Job’s trial which creates a momentum of the eye, following a circular pattern, to fall back on looking at the central figure of the suffering Job.

The modeling of the bald, strained, head of the prophet creates a sense of powerful forewarning, appropriate to the scriptural texts.  This statue originally stood outside, and Florentines gave it the name, ""Il Zuccone,"" or Pumpkinhead.</p><p>The Habakkuk sculpture is an example of Donatello's attempt at ""ekphrasis"" -- ""Ekphrasis has been considered generally to be a rhetorical device in which one medium of art tries to relate to another medium by defining and describing its essence and form, and in doing so, relate more directly to the audience, through its illuminative liveliness. A descriptive work of prose or poetry, a film, or even a photograph may thus highlight through its rhetorical vividness what is happening, or what is shown in, say, any of the visual arts, and in doing so, may enhance the original art and so take on a life of its own through its brilliant description. "" [from Wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ekphrasis]</p><p>Kenneth Gross, a scholar whose work, <em>The Dream of the Moving Statue</em>, tackles examples of ekphrasis in the dialogue between literature and fine art.  He writes about Donatello's Habakkuk and the artist's attempt to represent the prophet's Biblicalm iconoclastic rhetoric. ""Let us first imagine Donatello trying to answer the question, How does one make a statue of an iconoclast? ... How could the statue of an iconoclast face down the fact of being one of those things that ""have mouths, but do not speak; / eyes, but do not see / ...ears, but do not hear; / noses, but do not smell"" (Ps 115:5-8)?  Donatello's solution...is to construct a figure whose aspect entails a radical retroping of the merely given wordlessness, blindess, and senselessness of sculpture, a refiguring of the opacity that makes the idol a spiritual threat.

This essay argues that the narrative of the stoning of Stephen in Acts 6:8-8:1 does indeed depict a perfect martyr -- one perfectly suited, that is, to Luke's rhetorical purposes in the two-volume work now known as the Gospel of Luke and the Acts of the Apostles.  In this work Luke constructs for followers of ""the Way"" a genealogy reaching back into Israelite traditions, and a sociology that drives a wedge between them and their Jewish contemporaries. One means by which Acts constructs a divide between ""the Way"" and ""The Jews"" is to portray the former as compatible, and the latter as imcompatible, with Roman juridical ideas.  While ecclesial traditions of Jesus' death under Pontius Pilate and Paul's death in Rome posed a potential fault line in this construction, the killing of Stephen is an episode that is free from Roman juridical involvement.  In Luke's telling, the death of Stephen through a stoning carried out by an unruly mob underscores Jewish barbarity, creates a breach between the church and the Jews, and brackets Romans out of the originary violence that produced the church's first martyred follower of Jesus and marked its first great expansion.""

The octagonal, windowed dome echoed the baptismal basin directly below, setting a pattern for future structures, as Christianity spread.</p><p>""The octagonal baptistery adjoining the Lateran basilica constructed under the auspices of Constantine had in its second phase a circular baptismal font with a depth of 91 cm below floor level.  This Lateran baptistery was reconstructed under Sixtus III (432-440), and the font was given its present octagonal shape.  The baptismal pool was .5 meters in diameter, and so designed for multiple immersions.  Sixtus placed a Latin inscription over the eight sides of the entablature of the colonnade surrounding the room.  It sets forth his baptismal theology: </p><p><em>""Here is born from life-giving seed a people, consecrated to another city, whom the Spirit brings forth from the fertile waters.To plunge in the holy purifying flood the sinner, whom the wave receives as old but gives forth as hew.  None reborn is different from those it makes one, One font, one Spirit, one faith. Mother church as a virgin brought forth those who are born, whom she conceived by the divine breath and brought into being in the flowing water.The person who wants to be innocent is here made clean by washing, whether from the guilt of the first parent or one's own.Here is the font of life which bathes the whole world, its ultimate source the side of Christ wounded. Reborn in this font for the kingdom of heaven, the blessed life does not receive those born only once.Be no afraid of the number or kind of your sins, for the one born in this river will be holy."" </em>(Ferguson, p. 769, and from Brandenburg, Ancient Churches of Rome, p.324.)</p>",||||,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Roma2010_(5003218039).jpg,159,HCA set,460,||||,BLent01|BEast06|AEast03,,,,Lateran Baptistery,Roma2010_(5003218039)23c,,"Lateran Baptistery, domed interior",,||||,Baptism,on,Architecture,,,Rome,,,,2,460,10,Please visit the URL in the Copyright Source field on this page for details about reusing this image.
54414,2021-09-18 18:23:15.0,2011-01-29 16:45:30.0,Italy,,"<p>""Pantocrator or Pantokrator (from the Greek Παντοκράτωρ) is one of many names applied to God. When the Hebrew Bible was translated into Greek as the Septuagint, Pantokrator was used both for LORD of hosts and for El Shaddai. Christians ascribed the title to Jesus Christ. </p><p>The most common translation of Pantocrator is ""Almighty"" or ""All-powerful"". In this understanding, Pantokrator is a compound word formed from the Greek words for ""all"" and the noun ""strength"" (κρατος). This is often understood in terms of potential power; i.e., ability to do anything, omnipotence. </p><p>Another, more literal translation is ""Ruler of All"" or, less literally, ""Sustainer of the World"". In this understanding, Pantokrator is a compound word formed from the Greek for ""all"" and the verb meaning ""To accomplish something"" or ""to sustain something"" (κρατεω). This translation speaks more to God's actual power; i.e., God does everything (as opposed to God can do everything). </p><p>The Pantokrator, largely an Eastern Orthodox or Eastern Catholic theological conception is less common by that name in Western (Roman) Catholicism and largely unknown to most Protestants. In the West the equivalent image in art is known as Christ in Majesty, which developed a rather different iconography.</p><p> In the New Testament, Pantokrator is used once by Saint Paul (2 Cor 6:18). Aside from that one occurrence, the author of the Book of Revelation is the only New Testament author to use the word Pantokrator. The author of Revelation uses the word nine times, and while the references to God and Christ in Revelation are at times interchangeable, Pantokrator appears to be reserved for God alone. </p><p>The primary transference of the title ""Pantokrator"" to refer to Christ rather than the Creator was a result of the Christological shift that occurred during the fourth century, reflected through iconography; Christ Pantocrator has come to suggest Christ as a mild but stern, all-powerful judge of humanity. </p><p>The icon of Christ Pantokrator is one of the most widely used religious images of Orthodox Christianity. Generally speaking, in Byzantine church art and architecture, an iconic mosaic or fresco of Christ Pantokrator occupies the space in the central dome of the church, in the half-dome of the apse or on the nave vault.""

They have likened the fruitful ""vine"" to the Church, which the law makes wither, but the cross causes to flourish.  The death of Christ, the second Adam, gave birth to the Church, perhaps symbolized by the Blessed Virgin Mary as the second Eve.

""Mileseva is a Serbian Orthodox monastery located near Prijepolje, in southwest Serbia. It was founded by King Vladislav, in the years between 1234 and 1236. The church has frescoes by the most skillful artists of that time, including one of the most famous in Serbian heritage, the ""White Angel"", which depicts an angel on Christ's grave (at left). The first group of frescoes were produced in the 1230s. The other groups include works from the Turkish period. These thirteenth century frescoes may be considered to be the supreme achievement of all the painting in Europe of that time. The portraiture deals with bishops (altar space), warrior saints and martyrs (nave), as well as monks (narthex). The upper registers in the narthex represent Christ's earthly life. Below the resurrection composition on the south wall of the west bay, King Vladislav is depicted as being led to Christ by the Mother of God. The Nemanjic family is portrayed in the northeastern part of the narthex: Stefan Nemanja as the monk Simeon, Sava as the first archbishop, Stefan the First-Crowned as king, and his sons Radoslav and Vladislav. The frescoes in the narthex and the adjacent chapel were presumably painted in the 1230s and 1240s. They illustrate the last Judgment and the lives of some saints.""

He corresponded with Alcuin, and took part in the Adoptionist controversy, criticizing the views of Felix of Urgel and Elipandus of Toledo. As confessor to Adosinda, wife of Silo of Asturias, and as the master of Alcuin and Etherius of Osma, Beatus exercised wide influence. He is best remembered today as the author of the Commentary on the Apocalypse, written in 776, then revised in 784 and again in 786. This commentary was popular during the Middle Ages and survives in at least 34 manuscripts (usually called a beatus) from the 10th through the 16th centuries.""

A notorious theologian whose teachings were condemned by the Pope, he systematically attacked the abuses and practices of the medieval church, insisting that it should give up its worldly wealth. His controversial views were propagated by the Lollards, a heretical group with whom Chaucer’s Parson seems to share some sympathies. The movement was remarkable for its demand to read the Bible in English. Although attacked and forced underground in the Fifteenth Century, the numerous examples of vernacular Bibles surviving from this period are some indication of the popular influence of the Lollards.</p><p>The famous beginning of St. John’s Gospel is shown here: ‘In þe bigynnyng was | þe word & þe word | was at god, & god was | þe word.’ It is preceded by a prologue to the Gospel. This plain, pocket sized volume contains only an incomplete copy of the New Testament. Many Wycliffite Bibles were made deliberately small like this one to enhance their portability for use by itinerant preachers. Although we do not know who originally owned this copy, there are numerous sixteenth and seventeenth-century ownership inscriptions on the flyleaves, including a note that it belonged to John Lewis (1675-1747), an early biographer of Wycliffe.

55207,2021-04-09 09:51:28.0,2012-03-03 17:46:40.0,United States,,"<p>""This painting depicts the ceremony in which Pocahontas, daughter of the influential Algonkian chief Powhatan, was baptized and given the name Rebecca in an Anglican church. It took place in 1613 or 1614 in the colony at Jamestown, Virginia, the first permanent English settlement on the North American continent. Pocahontas is thought to be the earliest native convert to Christianity in the English colonies; this ceremony and her subsequent marriage to John Rolfe helped to establish peaceful relations between the colonists and the Tidewater tribes.<br><br>The figures of Pocahontas and the officiating minister are given prominence by their placement, their bright white clothing, and the light that shines upon them. Pocahontas kneels on the top level of a stepped dais, her head bowed and her hands clasped before her. Reverend Alexander Whiteaker raises his eyes and his left hand, while his right hand rests on the baptismal font. John Rolfe, Pocahontas’s future husband, stands behind her.<br><br>Other colonists and members of Pocahontas’s family look on, displaying a range of emotions. At the left of the painting, Sir Thomas Dale, deputy governor of the colony, has risen from his chair near the font to observe the event. Pocahontas’s regally dressed brother, Nantequaus, turns away from the ceremony as her uncle Opachisco leans in from the right. The seated, brooding figure of another uncle, Opechankanough, turns completely away from the ceremony while Pocahontas’s sister, with an infant, watches from the floor.<br><br>Chapman received the commission for the Rotunda painting in 1837 and selected Pocahontas as its subject. He may have chosen to paint her baptism because he had already (in 1836) completed a scene that showed her more widely depicted rescue of John Smith. Seeking to depict the scene of this ceremony accurately, Chapman traveled in England and America to examine objects and buildings from the early seventeenth century. Because the Jamestown church had since been torn down, he based his setting on a church that he believed to be of similar age and incorporated features appropriate to the colony, such as the pine columns; many details were based on a written description by a Jamestown resident. <br><br>Chapman created this painting in Washington, D.C., in the loft of a barn on G Street, N.W. His life during the time in which he worked on it was marked by great sadness and misfortune: his son died in February 1838, and two weeks later his daughter was born prematurely and survived only ten hours. He was also under mounting pressure from debts and worked quickly on the canvas to collect his payment; after completing it he noted in his day book that the money he received from the government for the painting was “barely equivalent to its cost” to him. The painting was delivered to the Capitol and installed in November 1840.""

This first section follows the iconographic cycle of the Utrecht Psalter. It opens with what Leroquais called the Psalter prologue, consisting of 8 extraordinary, full-page miniatures, and continues with 52 fascinating miniatures measuring approximately 15 x 32 cm (width of the page) at the beginning of each Psalm. Most pages feature decorated initials.Catalonia, c. 1340: from page 185 onwards we find 46 miniatures the width of the page and 15 to 25 cm high, surrounded by bright colours and divided into two or three bands each divided into two or three compartments. The few consisting of a single section appear on pages 328 and 340. The miniatures on pages 144, 146, 160, 162, 164 and 172 are also by Ferrer Bassa, although these are of a rather different style and may have been painted by the Catalan artist upon a sketch that the English artist left unfinished (judging by the composition, the iconography based on the Utrecht Psalter, and the stylistic and technical factors including drapes and the constant use of a royal blue that subsequently disappeared... the decorated letters on these folios are all by the English miniaturist). The folios from 185 onwards are characterised by the great iconographic freedom of the typological interpretation of both the Psalms and the New Testament prophecies."" [from M.

The passage illustrated is from the New Testament, Mark 14:43-46: ""And immediately, while he yet spake, cometh Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude with swords and staves, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. And he that betrayed him had given them a token, saying, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; take him, and lead him away safely.

Here, a glimpse into the cave reveals Christ's marble sarcophagus, now empty. Framed by the shadowy void of the tomb's entrance, the resurrected Christ, emitting rays of light, emerges triumphantly from the darkness. This scene was the last in a series of five predella panels (paintings on the base of an altarpiece) illustrating episodes from the Passion of Christ. The sequence, which can be reconstructed from surviving panels now in other collections, included the Betrayal of Judas, the Way to Calvary, the Crucifixion, and the Lamentation, and concluded with this panel of the Resurrection.""

The first part of his life was spent in Tunisia and the rest in Italy. In Salerno, Italy, he became a professor of medicine and his work attracted widespread attention. A few years later Constantine became a Benedictine monk, living the last two decades of his life in the Monte Cassino monastery.[1]It was in Italy where Constantine complied his vast opus, mostly composed of translations from Arabic sources. He translated into Latin books of the great masters of Arabic medicine: Razes Ali Ibn Massaouia Baghdad, Ibn Imran, Ibn Suleiman, and Ibn Al-Jazzar. These translations are housed today in libraries in Italy, Germany, France, Belgium, and England.

No one who had followed his previous career could have anticipated that this painter of urban life in Paris and London would undertake the project of painting virtually every event in the Gospels.<br><br>The Life of Our Lord Jesus Christ project took nearly ten years to complete. When it was done, it chronicled the entire life of Jesus as recorded in the New Testament in a series of 350 watercolors. To research the project Tissot traveled to Egypt, Syria, and Palestine in 1886–87, and again in 1890.<br><br>While in the Holy Land he closely observed the landscape, the vegetation, the architecture, and the manner of dress, and filled sketchbooks with what he saw. He talked with rabbis and studied Talmudic literature as well as theological and historical volumes. He believed that there was still a remaining “aura” in the places where the Gospel events took place, and he spoke of having mystical experiences that added to his careful research. What he wanted to create was something as close as possible to an eyewitness account of the life of Jesus.""

The design was originally adopted as the seal of the Society for the Abolition of Slavery in England in the 1780s, and appeared on several medallions for the society made by Josiah Wedgwood as early as 1787. Here, in addition to Whittier's poem, the appeal to conscience against slavery continues with two further quotes. The first is the scriptural warning, ""He that stealeth a man and selleth him, or if he be found in his hand, he shall surely be put to death. ""Exod[us] XXI, 16.""

D.129) is an illuminated marginal Psalter made in the middle of the 9th Century. It is a unique monument of Byzantine art at the time of the Iconoclasm, one of only three illuminated Byzantine Psalters to survive from the 9th century. According to one tradition, the miniatures are supposed to have been created clandestinely, and many of them are directed against Iconoclasts. Many contain explanations of the drawings written next to them, and little arrows point out from the main text to the illustration, to show which line the picture refers to. The polemical style of the whole ensemble is highly unusual, and a demonstration of the furious passions the Iconoclast dispute generated. Nikodim Kondakov hypothesized that the psalter was created in the famous monastery of St John the Studite in Constantinople. Other scholars believe that the liturgical responses it contains were only used in Hagia Sophia, and that it was therefore a product of the Imperial workshops in Constantinople, soon after the return of the Iconophiles to power in 843."" from Wikipedia",||||,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Chludov_Miriam.jpg,,,9th century,||||,AProp19|AEpip04,,,Exodus 14:19-31,State Historical Museum,Chludov_Miriam,,Crossing of the Red Sea and Miriam Dancing and Singing,,||||,Crossing the Red Sea|Singing|Dance|Exodus,on,Manuscript illumination,,Miriam (Biblical figure) ,Moscow,,,,2,850,1,Please visit the URL in the Copyright Source field on this page for details about reusing this image.

55596,2021-01-22 08:04:33.0,2013-05-28 13:46:36.0,United Kingdom,,"""The Winchester Bible is a Romanesque illuminated manuscript produced in Winchester between 1160 and 1175. With folios measuring 583 x 396 mm., it is the largest surviving 12th-century English Bible.[1] It may still be seen at the Winchester Cathedral Library, its home for more than eight hundred years.During the Romanesque period, the focus of major illumination in the West moved from the Gospel Book to the Psalter and the Bible, and the Winchester manuscript is one of the most lavish.The Bible comprises 468 leaves of calf-skin parchment. Given the large size of the pages, each bifolium required an entire skin: it is estimated that the manuscript incorporated the hides of some 250 calves.[2] Its first recorded mention, in 1622, describes the manuscript as a Bible in two volumes. Over the years it has been rebound twice, first in 1820, when it was divided into three volumes, and again in 1948. The Bible now spans four separate volumes bound in gold-tooled cream-coloured leather.Although many of the illuminations remain unfinished, the text itself is complete. Unusually, nearly the entire manuscript is in the hand of a single scribe, save for a few minor additions. Most manuscripts of this length would employ two or more scribes. It is estimated that the task of transcribing the entire Vulgate, here comprising both Old and New Testaments, two versions of the Psalms, and the Apocrypha, would have taken him some four years.In contrast, the illuminations reflect the work of at least six different hands. The art historian Walter Oakeshott first identified and named these artists in 1945, referring to them as the Master of the Leaping Figures, the Master of the Apocrypha Drawings, the Master of the Genesis Initial, the Master of the Amalekite, the Master of the Morgan Leaf, and the Master of the Gothic Majesty. Close examination of the illustration often reveals the work of two separate hands, with one providing the original sketch or design and the other painting in the colour and details.The artwork of the Winchester Bible is incomplete: many illuminations were left unfinished, while others were deliberately removed. The illuminations throughout the manuscript appear in varying stages of completion, ranging from rough outlines and inked drawings to unpainted gilded images and figures complete in all but the final details. In all, 48 of the major historiated initials that begin each book stand complete.Over the years, the manuscript has suffered at the hands of thieves and collectors. Some nine illuminated initials and at least one full-page illustration have been removed entirely. Of these, only one (the initial of Obadiah) has been recovered and restored to the text. Another missing leaf, showing scenes from the lives of Samuel on the recto and of King David on the verso, is now in the Morgan Library and is commonly referred to as the Morgan Leaf. Whether other similar full-page miniatures have been removed is unknown.""

Creatures with a human head and a bird's body (called sirens or harpies) were first described by the ancient Greek poet Homer as luring sailors with their enchanting singing and causing shipwrecks. For medieval Christians, they symbolized temptation. Here, the serpent-shaped tail further emphasizes the siren's evil nature.

But where there is a righteous man, no arrow strikes. But I wound those who live wickedly. Therefore let him who recognizes himself there look to himself."" [from Wikimedia]<br><br>""Vox Clamantis (""the voice of one crying out"") is a Latin poem of around 10,000 lines in elegiac verse by John Gower that recounts the events and tragedy of the 1381 Peasants' Rising. The poem takes aim at the corruption of society and laments the rise of evil. Gower takes an entirely aristocratic side in the poem, regarding the peasants' claims as invalid and their actions as following the anti-Christ.Gower's earlier Mirour de l'Omme had proposed the metaphor of the microcosm: man is, within himself, a miniature world and a metaphor of the world. As disorders occur in the man, they occur in the wider world. In Vox Clamantis, the same general trope is employed, but Gower emphasizes the role of the political, with a dire view of the effects of the polis and political on both the man and the cosmos. Gower outlines the proper duty of each of the three estates of society and argues that none of those alive were close to acting in a proper manner.The poem is an important account of life under Richard II in London and the effects of the peasants' rebellion. Using the rebellion (which clinched several demands for the peasants) as an allegory, Gower expresses his concern for a future vacant of law and education. Gower, who frequently stressed the importance of each concept in his work, feared that either would be meaningless in a land rife with barbarism and chaos, and men of his position would have no purpose.""

55663,2021-01-13 20:30:45.0,2013-06-20 13:43:37.0,United States,,"""The exceptional quality of this cross demonstrates the high level of technical skill attained by the monastic artisans of the 15th century. Its multiple openings create a complicated pattern composed of nine interlocking circles enclosed within a quatrelobe frame. Intricate ribbon work fills the boundary between this frame and the circular shapes of the interior. Fine linear decoration completes the design and accentuates the delicate appearance of the composition. At the outside edges of the terminal points of the cross, intertwining lines end in serpentine curves. The snake-like forms assume a more distinct shape on either side of the looping brackets that secure the cross to its base. Such details possibly incorporate references to the brazen serpent of Moses as described in the Book of Numbers (21:4-9). In the wake of a devastating plague of poisonous snakes, God instructed the Israelites to erect a brass serpent upon a pole. Because gazing upon this object was believed to cure those bitten, Christians interpreted the brazen serpent as a prefiguration of the redemptive cross of Christ. The three large crosses at the terminal positions appear to emerge, plant-like, from the diamond-shaped supports that connect them to the frame. The organic shape of these details alludes to the sprouting leaves of the Tree of Paradise, an object with which the cross was often associated. The perforated crosses that flank the shaft would have secured the fabric with which the cross was ""dressed"" for processions. The intricate patterns and brilliant execution make this object one of the most important crosses to exist outside of Ethiopia.""

It was completed while Smart was imprisoned for outstanding debt at the King's Bench Prison, and the work is his final exploration of religion. Although Smart spent a large portion of his life in and out of debt, he was unable to survive his time in the prison and died soon after completing the Hymns.Smart's Hymns are one of the first works of hymns dedicated to children, and they are intended to teach Christian virtues. Unlike some of the other works produced by Smart after his release from a mental asylum, such as A Song to David or Hymns and Spiritual Songs, this work was a success and went into many immediate editions. Part of the success of this work lies in the simplicity and accessibility of the text. However, Smart died before he ever saw the proceeds of the work and never learned of the book's success."" -- [from Wikipedia]",||||,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Smart_Hymn21_Generosity.jpg,,,1771,||||,CProp20|AEpip05,,,Luke 16:1-13,,Smart_Hymn21_Generosity,,Generosity,,||||,Children|Hymns|Generosity,on,Books and manuscripts,"Smart, Christopher, 1722-1771",,,,,,2,1771,1,Please visit the URL in the Copyright Source field on this page for details about reusing this image.

Their hooded robes rendered such acts anonymous, in conformity with Christ's injunction that good works should not be done for vain praise. This extremely rare work was commissioned in about 1395–1400 by the Confraternity of Saint Mary Magdalene in Borgo San Sepolcro and would have been carried in religious processions. On one side it shows the members of the confraternity kneeling before their patron saint, who is serenaded by a choir of angels. Mary Magdalene's ointment jar decorates the sleeves of their robes. On the reverse side is the Flagellation of Christ—a reminder of the penitential practices the confraternity would have performed. The lightly drawn features of the face of Christ are modern; the original was removed in the nineteenth century and is now in the Camposanto Teutonico, Rome. The banner is otherwise remarkably well preserved.""

55878,2020-12-14 16:27:46.0,2014-04-28 14:21:35.0,United Kingdom,,"""Mariawald was a Cistercian abbey founded in 1480. The Cistercians were a monastic order established in 1098 in Burgundy at Citeaux. The founder of the Cistercians had broken away from the Benedictines which had been the first monastic order to be established in Europe, in the 6th century.During the Revolutionary struggles in France and the subsequent religious upheavals under Napoleon, many monastic institutions on the continent were 'secularised' and their buildings destroyed. The abbey of Mariawald was closed down in 1802 but fortunately its buildings, including the cloisters, remain largely intact. However, the stained glass windows had been removed...Each window had two panels depicting scenes from the Old Testament and two panels with scenes from the New Testament....This type of narrative arrangement is known as 'typological'. Each Old Testament story was a 'type' or a prefigurement of a New Testament story ('antitype'). The prophets on each window would hold text from the Bible relating to the Old and New Testament stories. For example, this panel shows the Old Testament story of 'Jacob Tempting Esau'. It was placed in the window just above that of the New Testament scene of 'The Temptations of Christ (Museum no. C.237-1928). Jacob and Esau were the sons of Isaac. Jacob tempted the hungry Esau with food in exchange for his birthright as the eldest son and heir. This event prefigured that of the devil tempting Jesus Christ with worldly goods.The typological arrangement was popular in the Middle Ages. The stories were reproduced in manuscripts and in engravings from woodcuts and collectively became known as 'Biblia Pauperum' ('Bibles of the Poor'). At the end of the 15th century the Biblia Pauperum were printed in book form and sold in their thousands. These books were used as design sources for artworks including stained glass panels.""

Its three parts comprise 45 gilded copper plates modeled on Byzantine paragons, similar to the Shrine of the Three Kings at Cologne Cathedral. Originally manufactured as panels, they were assembled as an altar in secondary utilization circa 1330.[1]The tripartite concept is reflected in the arrangement of the plates. According to the biblical exegesis, the depictions are split into three rows of the eras of Adam and Noah, of Abraham, David and the Babylonian captivity and finally of Jesus' life, placed in the central part. The columns of adjacent plates of different ages symbolise their connection according to the ideas of the typology theory. The arrangement may refer to the mystic doctrines of the medieval theologian Hugh of Saint Victor.  American scholar Elfie Raymond, professor of philosophy and hermeneutics at Sarah Lawrence College of New York produced a masterful online catalog of the typology of virtues found in the theological program.""

This takes place on Ascension Day, when five attractive wells are dressed together with a children’s well.Well dressing is a custom found primarily in or near Derbyshire and, although the Church at one time banned the custom as water worship, the wells are often decorated with Christian themes.Well dressing is thought to go back to Pagan times, a ritual performed to give thanks for the supply of fresh water. Another school of thought claims that the Romans introduced the custom into Britain, the philosopher Seneca stating that – "" where springs or rivers flow we should build altars or make sacrifices.""Whatever the true origin, Tissington, recorded as dressing a well in 1349, is the oldest authenticated instance of well dressing in Derbyshire.It is probable that well dressing took place in 1350, in thanksgiving for the Tissington's escape from the Black Death, which was attributed to the purity of its water.""

Spanish reports tell of its opulence that was 'fabulous beyond belief'. The majority of the gold collected to fill the ransom room for the Inca Atahualpa was collected from Coricancha.The Church of Santo Domingo was built on the site, using the ruined foundations of the temple that was flattened by the Spanish in the 17th century, and is a fine example of where Inca stonework has been incorporated into the structure of a colonial building. Major earthquakes have severely damaged the church, but the Inca stone walls, built out of huge, tightly-interlocking blocks of stone, still stand thanks to the sophisticated stone masonry.",||||,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Lascar_La_iglesia_de_Santo_Domingo_built_on_the_ruins_of_The_Coricancha_temple_(Cuzco)_(4577531523).jpg,,,17th century,||||,,,,,,aril-Chperu,,Iglesia de Santo Domingo,,||||,Church,on,Architecture,,,Cusco,,,,2,1600,,Please visit the URL in the Copyright Source field on this page for details about reusing this image.

56017,2020-12-16 14:29:05.0,2014-10-23 09:41:41.0,United States,,"""Missouri artist George Caleb Bingham's Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap is among the most popular American paintings addressing the theme of westward expansion. Rich with symbolism, it helped establish the mythic status of Daniel Boone and legends of western settlement. Like Charles Wimar in The Abduction of Daniel Boone's Daughter by the Indians (1853, WU 4355), Bingham drew from Christian and classical imagery to justify and heroicize westward expansion and the ideal of Manifest Destiny, or the providential mission of the American nation to settle the frontier. Referring to Boone's first journeys into Kentucky in the early 1770s, the group is pictured traveling from east to west, dramatically emerging from the sun-filled landscape in the background and crossing into the dark, foreboding landscape in the foreground, where the snarled trees help signify the dangerous power of nature. Portrayed with idealized features and poses, the intrepid Daniel Boone, a rifle resting on his shoulder, suggests the figure of Moses - an archetype for pioneer patriarchs - leading his people toward the Promised Land, while Rebecca Boone, atop the horse, suggests the Virgin Mary, symbolizing the courageous spirit of pioneer women."" -- Kemper Art Museum, Saint Louis University",||||,http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:George_Caleb_Bingham_-_Daniel_Boone_escorting_settlers_through_the_Cumberland_Gap.jpg,,,1851-1852,||||,,,,,"Kemper Art Museum, Saint Louis University",Danl-Boone-Cumberland2310,,Daniel Boone Escorting Settlers through the Cumberland Gap ,,||||,Manifest Destiny,on,Painting,"Bingham, George Caleb, 1811-1879","Boone, Daniel, 1734-1820 |Boone, Rebecca, 1739-1813 ",St. Louis,MO,,,2,1851,,Please visit the URL in the Copyright Source field on this page for details about reusing this image.

In the early tenth century, a monk called Guido of Arezzo derived the solfège method to aid monks to learn how to sight-sing with ease, assigning each note of a six-note scale a syllable (in Guido’s case, ut, re, mi, fa, sol, and la). The ‘Guidonian hand’ elaborated this system by assigning a note to each part of the hand. This allowed singers to understand how notes related to each other... <br><br> The versatility of the hand, with its nineteen ‘common locations’ meant that it could be used to represent a number of different things – dates, music, and even...to facilitate prayer, with each location on the hand given a different contemplative value for ‘meditatio nocturna per manum’.""<br><br> -- from the project blog of “Turning Over a New Leaf: Manuscript Innovation in the Twelfth Century” based at the Institute for Cultural Disciplines, Universiteit Leiden.",||||,"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Simon_Marmion_(Flemish,_active_1450_-_1489)_-_The_Martyrs_and_the_Pure_Sing_Praises_to_God_-_Google_Art_Project.jpg",,,1475,||||,CAdvt03,,,Isaiah 12:2-6,J.

No one who had followed his previous career could have anticipated that this painter of urban life in Paris and London would undertake the project of painting virtually every event in the Gospels.<br><br>The Life of Our Lord Jesus Christ project took nearly ten years to complete. When it was done, it chronicled the entire life of Jesus as recorded in the New Testament in a series of 350 watercolors. To research the project Tissot traveled to Egypt, Syria, and Palestine in 1886–87, and again in 1890.<br><br>While in the Holy Land he closely observed the landscape, the vegetation, the architecture, and the manner of dress, and filled sketchbooks with what he saw. He talked with rabbis and studied Talmudic literature as well as theological and historical volumes. He believed that there was still a remaining “aura” in the places where the Gospel events took place, and he spoke of having mystical experiences that added to his careful research. What he wanted to create was something as close as possible to an eyewitness account of the life of Jesus.""

Heraclius' support of Monothelism, a compromise with the newly conquered eastern areas of Christendom, lasted only as long as his reign, as Pope Martin I called a Lateran Council in 649 to condemn Monothelism as heresy. The heresy supported the ""one will"" nature of Christ.  It was practiced in North African and eastern Mediterranean churches, and joining those churches with the main Byzantine church was the aim of the adoption of the Monothelist viewpoint. The church where this fresco portrait appears, Santa Maria Antiqua, is the oldest Christian building in the Roman Forum area. </p><p>A second possibility for the identity of Abba Cyrus is Cyrus of Batna, a late 6th century church historian (hence the pen and writing table) who wrote Syriac biographies of Justin II and Tiberius II.

Together with Basil I's Homilies of St Gregory Nazianzus, the Paris Psalter is considered a key monument of the so-called Macedonian Renaissance in Byzantine art during the 10th century...[its] miniatures are so Hellenistic in execution and so unlike the received notion of what medieval art in general and Byzantine art in particular should look like, that most 19th-century authorities dated the manuscript to the time of Justinian. The Byzantists Hugo Buchthal and Kurt Weitzmann conclusively demonstrated that the book was created in the 10th century, however."" -- Wikipedia",||||,https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Paris_psaulter_gr139_fol419v.jpg,,,10th century,||||,AProp19,,,Exodus 14:19-31,Bibliothèque nationale de France,crossingSea83gh91oa,,Crossing of the Red Sea,,||||,Exodus|Crossing the Red Sea,on,,,,Paris,,,,2,900,1,Please visit the URL in the Copyright Source field on this page for details about reusing this image.
