In this path-breaking volume, Lewis Baldwin traces King's vision and activism not to his formal philosophical and theological development but directly to his roots in Southern black culture, where King spent most of his 39 years. King's appropriation of the Bible, Gandhi, American participatory democracy, Boston personalism, and the theologies of Reinhold Niebuhr and the Social Gospel makes sense, Baldwin argues, only against his visceral and abiding identification with black culture and the black Christian tradition. Working directly with the trove of King's sermons, speeches, and unpublished papers, Baldwin has reconstructed the pain and joy, the defeat and triumph King experienced in his formative family relationships, in the black church, in his childhood and education, in his marriage and children, in segregated black Atlanta, and in his leadership of America's civil rights movement."" -- Publisher's website.","1991","2022-05-06 17:24:29","2022-05-06 17:24:57","","","348","","","","","","","","","","Fortress Press","Minneapolis, Minnesota","English","","","","","OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch","","OCLC: 22243653","","","","","Religion; African Americans; États-Unis; Southern States; États-Unis (Sud); États-Unis (Sud) Noirs américains; Religion.

Established and emerging scholars explore Martin Luther King, Jr.'s global vision and his lasting relevance to a globalized rights culture. The editors further explain that this edited collection looks at: King afresh in his own historical context, while also refocusing his legacy of ideas and social praxis in broader directions for today and tomorrow. Employing King's metaphor of ""the great world house,"" with major attention to racism, poverty, and war - or what he called 'the evil triumvirate""--The focus is on King's appraisal of and approach to the global-human struggle in the 1950s and 60s, and on the extent to which his social witness and praxis takes on new hues and pertinence not only in the ongoing struggles against racism, poverty and economic injustice, and violence and human destruction, but also in the mounting efforts to eliminate problems such sexism, homophobia, and religious bigotry and intolerance from the global landscape. The conclusion is that King's ideas and models of social protest are not only alive but also growing in vitality and popularity in the 21st century, especially as humans worldwide are struggling daily with the lingering, antiquated thinking and behavior around race and ethnicity, the widening gap between ""the haves"" and ""the have-nots,"" the mounting cycles of violence, torture, and terrorism, and the frustrating and growing chasms resulting from religious pluralism and the subordination and marginalization of certain sectors of the human family based on gender and sexuality""--","2019","2022-05-06 17:25:50","2022-05-06 18:07:07","","","390","","","","","Reclaiming the great world house","The Morehouse College King Collection Series on Civil & Human Rights","","","","University of Georgia Press","Athens","English","","","","","OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch","","OCLC: 1107807831","","","","","Human rights; Aspect social.

Provides an in-depth analysis of King's views on the roles that religion and morality ought to play, not only in public debate concerning political choices and law, but also in efforts to create political and legal structures that are just and to perpetuate participatory democracy. The Legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. focuses considerable attention on King's refusal to separate religious faith and moral considerations from politics, legal matters, and social reformism. In so doing, it demonstrates King's remarkable ability to transcend church-state boundaries and to formulate an alliance that permeated every facet of American life. This volume reveals how King moved beyond southern particularism to create a more democratic America and a more inclusive world. Among the topics covered are King's relationship to various American political traditions and figures, King's theories of civil disobedience and his understanding of the Constitution, and the influence of moral law and personal idealism on King's teachings.","2002","2022-05-06 17:27:19","2022-05-06 17:28:56","","","316","","","","","The legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr.","","","","","University of Notre Dame Press","Notre Dame, Ind.","English","","","","","OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch","","OCLC: 48884945","","","","","United States; History; Histoire; États-Unis; 20th century; Religion and politics; 20e siècle.

Too many people continue to think of Dr. King only as ""a southern civil rights leader"" or ""an American Gandhi,"" thus ignoring his impact on poor and oppressed people around the world. """"In a Single Garment of Destiny"""" is the first book to treat King's positions on global liberation struggles through the prism of his own words and activities. From the pages of this extraordinary collection, King emerges not only as an advocate for global human rights but also as a towering figure who collaborated with Eleanor Roosevelt, Albert J. Luthuli, Thich Nhat Hanh, and other national and international figures in addressing a multitude of issues we still struggle with today--from racism, poverty, and war to religious bigotry and intolerance.

"38TXZZ9Y","book","1995","Baldwin, Lewis V.","Toward the beloved community: Martin Luther King Jr. and South Africa","","978-0-8298-1102-5","","","","Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday is celebrated in over one hundred countries, yet his international influence has received little attention. That King devoted his life to the civil and human rights struggle in the United States is well known; less well known, however, is that his concern for social justice stretched well beyond the borders of this country. It was in fact King's ideal of the beloved community - an inclusive and interracial society epitomized by freedom and justice for all - that transformed his national insight into a global vision. And it was this global vision that inspired King, and the heirs of his legacy, to play a profound role in South Africa's liberation from apartheid. Meticulously drawing on fugitive archival material, private correspondence, interviews, sermons, public speeches, and published works, Vanderbilt's Lewis V. Baldwin carefully traces the relationship between King's life and thought and that of great South African leaders such as Chief Albert J. Luthuli, Steve Biko, Oliver Tambo, Nelson Mandela, Allan Boesak, and Desmond Tutu. The author recounts King's responses to the anti-apartheid struggle in the 1950s and 1960s, as well as his impact on anti-apartheid activists and movements in and outside South Africa in the 1970s and 1980s - including the conflict between King's legacy of nonviolence and the Black Consciousness Movement that swept through Africa as colonialism fell.","1995","2022-05-06 17:43:57","2022-05-06 17:43:57","","","265","","","","","Toward the beloved community","","","","","Pilgrim Press","Cleveland, Oh.","English","","","","","OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch","","OCLC: 32467758","","","","","Apartheid; South Africa.

Drawing on personal prayers that King recited as a seminarian and graduate student, preacher, pastor, and then civil rights leader, award-winning historian Lewis Baldwin explains how King turned to both private prayer and meditation for his own spiritual fulfillment, and to public prayer as part of his sermonic discourse, as an aspect of his pastoral care, and as a way of moving, inspiring, and reaffirming people in the context of a crusade for equal rights, social justice, and peace.

King is treated here as both a global figure and a forerunner of much of what is currently associated with contemporary globalization theory and praxis. The contributors of this volume agree that King must be understood not only as a thinker, visionary, and social change agent in his own historical context, but also in terms of his meaning for the different generations who still appeal to him as an authority, inspiration, and model of exemplary service to humanity.

For African Americans especially, communal engagement is a sacred experience that stretches from the mundane to the spectacular in a cyclical historical pattern. DeWayne R. Stallworth illumines the broadness of this African American religious experience by looking back to the first shared experience of unbiased community that occurred during slavery. He then explores the difficulties of maintaining such a unity under the threat of supremacy as experienced through systemic structures of both white and black privilege. Most important, Stallworth unpacks how the black religious leader, although caricatured as uncouth and ignorant, remained the moral compass for community progression and uplift until the civil rights era. This provocative book is essential reading for anyone with a desire to obtain a broader and deeper understanding of what it means to be black, religious, and American in the twenty-first-century United States. --","2019","2022-05-06 18:11:25","2022-05-06 18:11:50","","","","","","","","","","","","","Pickwick Publications","Eugene, Oregon","English","","","","","OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch","","OCLC: 1114283224","","","","","African Americans; Religious life.

Carter has also served as the chapel's only dean for 42 years. This essay explores his life pilgrimage as an ""organic intellectual"" or ""scholar-activist,"" with a special focus on how he has combined academic excellence in teaching and scholarship with a vital Christian ethic, social justice activism, and service to humanity. Much attention is also devoted to Carter's intellectual and spiritual sources, especially King, Mohandas K. Gandhi, and Daisaku Ikeda, whom Carter views as ""moral cosmopolitans."" Of particular importance is Carter's own emergence as ""a prophetic, moral cosmopolitan voice"" that still provokes and challenges on topics ranging from religion to spirituality and health to race, education, pan-religious dialogue, issues of civil and human rights, and the Black social Gospel tradition.","2021","2022-06-14 14:52:41","2022-06-14 14:52:41","2022-06-14 14:52:41","93-112","","1/2","9","","","The Freedom to Act on Conscience","","","","","","","English","Copyright Indiana University Press Autumn 2021","","","","ProQuest","","Num Pages: 93-112 Place: Bloomington, United States Publisher: Indiana University Press","","","","","Religion; Education; Race; Christianity; Teaching; Social justice; Traditions; Human rights; Civil rights; Academic freedom; Spirituality; Pilgrimages; Ethnic Interests; Activism; Activists; Chapels; Health education; Men's Studies; Oppression; Places of worship; Religiosity; Religious beliefs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
