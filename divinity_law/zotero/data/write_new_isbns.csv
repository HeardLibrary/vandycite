This paper is intended to illustrate the value of this principle by focussing on some disturbing points in the gospel accounts of crucifixion in the light of recent accounts of torture and terror in Latin America. It argues that documentation of torture and abuse in Latin American military regimes can illuminate neglected aspects of Jesus’ passion presented in the gospels. Most importantly this involves recognition that crucifixion was a form of torture that served a wider purpose than execution and was used to demonstrate the state’s power and terrorise those who might oppose it. Within this framework, one issue in the horror of Jesus torture and crucifixion which has been completely neglected in Christian tradition—the degree of sexual abuse that it involved—can be addressed honestly and openly. My central contention is that crucifixion in the ancient world carried a strongly sexual element and should be understood as a form of sexual abuse. The gospels indicate that Jesus was subjected to a high degree of sexual humiliation and was possibly a victim of sexual assault. The final part of this paper suggests the constructive purposes that the acknowledgement of this sexual abuse might serve.",2018,8/25/21 19:43,8/25/21 19:45,8/25/21 19:43,,,,,,,"Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse",,,,,"Centre for Theology and Public Issues, University of Otago",,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,,,,ourarchive.otago.ac.nz,,Accepted: 2018-11-08T19:41:43Z,,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\DEU449E9\Tombs - 2018 - Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse Text .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\3LSRUH76\8558.html",,,,,,,,,"Tombs, David John",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brown,978-3-948670-10-8,,,https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/16321,"This article examines the impact which Peter R.L Brown’s half century of scholarship has made on the historiography of Christianity. This article surveys five recurring motifs or theoretical approaches to Christianization which epitomize Brown’s interpretive method as an historian of Christianity: Christianization as social change, Christianization as continuity, Christianization as revolution, Christianization as simultaneously diverse and universal, and Christianization as unfamiliar. Individually, these themes challenge monolithic interpretations of “Christianization” in Late Antiquity. Taken as a whole, these themes reflect Brown’s emphasis on the paradoxical aspects of Christianity in Late Antiquity. As Brown himself has put it, his goal in constantly overturning scholarly assumptions about Christianization was to achieve “a sense of the salutary vertigo” in which the historian encounters ancient Christianity with “the same combination of wonder and respect that makes for fruitful travel in a foreign land.”",2019,7/27/21 22:40,6/30/22 18:45,7/27/21 22:40,45-70,,,,,,“Salutary Vertigo”,Études Byzantines et Post Byzantines,"new series, vol.
