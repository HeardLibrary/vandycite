8,,"Sasson, Jack",2011,978-1-907534-33-1,,,,"This volume honours the distinctive contribution to Hebrew Bible studies over four decades by Cheryl Exum, Professor Emerita of Biblical Studies in the University of Sheffield. Her special interests have lain, first, in the modern literary criticism of the Hebrew Bible, where her key work was Tragedy and Biblical Narrative: Arrows of the Almighty. Asecond area has been feminist criticism of the Hebrew Bible; here her notable contributions were Fragmented Women: Feminist (Sub)versions of Biblical Narratives and Plotted, Shot, and Painted: Cultural Representations of Biblical Women. A more recent, and now almost favourite, theme is the Bible and cultural studies, especially the Bible and art. Key works here have been a series of edited volumes, such as Beyond the Biblical Horizon: The Bible and the Arts, and The Bible in Film / The Bible and Film. Her fourth area of continuing interest has been the Song of Songs, with many articles culminating in her perceptive commentary in the Old Testament Library series. In this rich volume, 25 of her friends and colleagues offer her papers on all these themes. Several are on or around the Song of Songs (Graeme Auld, Fiona Black, David Clines, Sara Japhet, Martti Nissinen, Yair Zakovitch), and topics of feminist interest (Yairah Amit, Athalya Brenner, Claudia Camp, Hugh Pyper, Jack Sasson).

The authors, representing Wesleyan backgrounds in this volume, all hold concern for a suffering world, believing that socioeconomic systems, prescribed roles, stereotypes, or power differentials cannot dictate normative destinies for persons or for living systems. Each writer calls for movement from suffering to surviving to thriving in the midst of discussions about how alienation, in a variety of contexts, can be transformed into connection and reconnection through intentional shifts in circumstance and human agency. A hermeneutic of healing and justice focused on human relationship with the environment, economic and social systems that disconnect and reconnect, socio-cultural and economic constructs that divide or heal, encountered difference that brings opportunity, and various manifestations of personal pain that can turn to hope, provides a significant, realistic alternative to suffering and alienation. Meaningful connection to each other and to the earth through the alleviation of suffering provides hope for the integrity and future of humankind and the healing of the planet. This book is an offering to those who are called to work for change and a challenge to those who do not believe that change should or could happen. Alienation is not the final word.

In this new challenging modus, religion raises questions about identity, power, rationality, subjectivity, law and safety, but above all: religion questions, contests and even blurs the borders between the public and the private. These phenomena urge to rethink what are often considered to be clear differences between religions, between the public and the private and between the religious and the secular. In this volume scholars from a range of different disciplines map the different aspects of the dynamics of changing, contesting and contested religious identities.",2017,9/29/20 17:14,11/28/22 19:24,,,,,,,,,Numen book series : studies in the history of religions ; Volume 156,,,,Brill,Leiden ;,eng,,,,,catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,Identification (Religion); Identity (Psychology); Religious aspects,,,,,,"Becking, Bob",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,"Contesting religious identities: transformations, disseminations and mediations"

83,,"Segovia, Fernando F.",2018,,,,,"A key principle in the work of Latin American liberation theologians has been a willingness to take their Latin American social context seriously as an aid for understanding biblical texts. This paper is intended to illustrate the value of this principle by focussing on some disturbing points in the gospel accounts of crucifixion in the light of recent accounts of torture and terror in Latin America. It argues that documentation of torture and abuse in Latin American military regimes can illuminate neglected aspects of Jesus’ passion presented in the gospels. Most importantly this involves recognition that crucifixion was a form of torture that served a wider purpose than execution and was used to demonstrate the state’s power and terrorise those who might oppose it. Within this framework, one issue in the horror of Jesus torture and crucifixion which has been completely neglected in Christian tradition—the degree of sexual abuse that it involved—can be addressed honestly and openly. My central contention is that crucifixion in the ancient world carried a strongly sexual element and should be understood as a form of sexual abuse. The gospels indicate that Jesus was subjected to a high degree of sexual humiliation and was possibly a victim of sexual assault. The final part of this paper suggests the constructive purposes that the acknowledgement of this sexual abuse might serve.",2018,8/25/21 19:43,8/25/21 19:45,8/25/21 19:43,,,,,,,"Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse",,,,,University of Otago,Otago,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,,,,ourarchive.otago.ac.nz,,,,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\DEU449E9\Tombs - 2018 - Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse Text .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\3LSRUH76\8558.html",,,,,,,,,"Tombs, David John",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,"Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse: Text and Context"

When complete, the twelve volumes of the series will cover all the Sundays in the three-year lectionary cycle, along with movable occasions, such as Christmas Day, Epiphany, Holy Week, and All Saints' Day.For each lectionary text, preachers will find four brief essays--one each on the theological, pastoral, exegetical, and homiletical challenges of the text. This gives preachers sixteen different approaches to the proclaimation of the Word on any given occasion.The editors and contributors to this series are world-class scholars, pastors, and writers representing a variety of denominations and traditions. And while the twelve volumes of the series will follow the pattern of the Revised Common Lectionary, each volume will contain an index of biblical passages so that nonlectionary preachers, as well as teachers and students, may make use of its contents.",1/27/09,1/5/15 20:28,7/10/18 19:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Westminster John Knox Press,Louisville,English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/Feasting-Word-Pentecost-Season-Propers/dp/0664230989/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1420489325&sr=8-7&keywords=feasting+on+the+word+year+b,,,"Bartlett, David L.; Taylor, Barbara Brown",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1ST edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,"Feasting on the Word: Year B, Vol. 3: Pentecost and Season after Pentecost 1"

ITC envisioned itself as providing rigorous and relevant theological education that would enable Black churches and their communities to seize this new horizon. ITC would serve the age by preparing clergy to lead Black communities and their churches. As important as ITC’s history was in influencing my decision to enroll, so was my own family heritage. Long before the constituent schools came together, Gammon Theological Seminary, one of ITC’s parent institutions, had trained Black clergy for almost a century. So for ITC, the mission that began in 1958 did not end with the era of civil rights gains; it only adapted to the changing landscape of racialization. Indeed, ITC’s commitment to educate leaders extended to the entire Black church, and its many communities, not simply to those whom the church had historically privileged. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",2016,11/22/22 20:55,11/22/22 20:55,,,,,,,,A liberating spirituality,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\5XYDW9JL\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,Graduate Education at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs): A Student Perspective

Clooney has gathered nine American Jesuit scholars teaching at universities to reflect on their scholarly work, why they engage in it, and how the work they do coheres with their self-understanding as Jesuits. In accounts that weave together scholarly lives and personal stories, the contributors to this volume explore the irreducible diversity of their experiences and criticize the dominant modern synthesis that shaped Jesuit institutions of higher education from the 1960s to the 1990s. While the contrapuntal display of voices enunciated in this collection will unsettle the conventional and still dominant ways of talking about Jesuits, scholarship, and religious intellectual inquiry, Jesuit Postmodern does not end the conversation, but pushes scholars to talk more critically and imaginatively.",3/7/06,10/30/14 17:35,10/30/14 17:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lexington Books,"Lanham, MD",English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/Jesuit-Postmodern-Scholarship-Vocation-Identity/dp/073911400X,,,"Clooney, Francis X.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,"Jesuit Postmodern: Scholarship, Vocation, and Identity in the 21st Century"

Less well known is that the film contains references to what was, at the time of its release, cutting edge biblical scholarship and Life of Jesus research. This research, founded on the acceptance of the Historical Jesus as a Jew who needs to be understood within the context of his time, is implicitly referenced through the setting of the Brian character within a tumultuous social and political background. This collection is a compilation of essays from foremost scholars of the historical Jesus and the first century Judaea, and includes contributions from George Brooke, Richard Burridge, Paula Fredriksen, Steve Mason, Adele Reinhartz, Bart Ehrman, Amy-Jill Levine, James Crossley, Philip Davies, Joan Taylor, Bill Telford, Helen Bond, Guy Steibel, David Tollerton, David Shepherd and Katie Turner. The collection opens up the Life of Brian to renewed investigation and, in so doing, uses the film to reflect on the historical Jesus and his times, revitalising the discussion of history and Life of Jesus research. The volume also features a Preface from Terry Jones, who not only directed the film, but also played Brian's mum""--, "" ... a conference held by the Department of Theology and Religious Studies, King's College London, in June 2014, with sponsorship from the School of Arts and Humanities, and support too from T & T Clark Bloomsbury.

In medieval times, spiritual direction was common in the Roman Catholic monastic traditions. It extended significantly into Protestant Christianity in the late twentieth century by predominantly white and affluent organizations. Spiritual direction has progressively become a global, multi-religious and interfaith practice. This book is a comprehensive and concise text from a spiritual director of color, offering inclusive resources and tools to spiritual directors of many faiths and for people of diverse cultures and traditions. Core skills such a deep listening, hospitality, and discernment are presented with cutting-edge lessons on internal liberation, systemic trauma, and imaginative discovery. Spiritual direction is taught by more than 100 educational institutions and spirituality centers in the US alone, but typical curriculum generally does not reflect current cultural reality and growing diversity.

Floyd-Thomas’s chapter, “The Good, the m.A.A.d., and the Holy: Kendrick Lamar’s Meditations on Sin and Moral Agency in the Post-Gangsta Era,” examines the ways in which Lamar grapples with notions of sin on both an individual and a communal basis within the African American experience. Here Floyd-Thomas argues the most consistent and unwavering facet of Lamar’s work has been his incisive commentary and musing on the cumulative impact immoral and ‘illicit’ acts have had on his generation born and raised in the shadow of gangsta rap’s emergence within the global cultural milieu. Exploring the relevance of ‘West Coast’ sensibilities as fomenters of Lamar’s interest in morality, alongside thorough analysis drawing parallels with St. Augustine, Floyd-Thomas presents Lamar as a marker of the contemporary complexities concerning making right-action in a world with so little of it and leaves readers with the impression that, at the very least, Lamar is honest enough to help navigate the moral terrain. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Christopher M.

Among the first to bring a focus of scholarly attention to the period of ancient Israel's creativity after the Exile, she has also been a leader in foregrounding the Jewish tradition within the interpretative discourse of biblical scholars. And as a woman scholar, she has advanced the study of issues in the Hebrew Bible that impinge on the concerns of women ancient and modern. Tamara Eskenazi was awarded the 2008 National Jewish Book Award for her volume The Torah: A Women's Commentary and the 2011 National Jewish Book Award in Women's Studies for her commentary on Ruth in the Jewish Publication Society Bible Commentary series. The 26 articles offered to Tamara Eskenazi by her friends in this volume represent the range of her interests in all things biblical and Jewish. From Genesis to the New Testament to modern Hebrew fiction, from technical studies on the prophets or Qumran to penetrating insights on her beloved philosopher Levinas, this volume beautifully represents the range and depth of Jewish culture.

Drawing on Jewish history, literary studies, folklore, art history and the history of science, it examines both the historical depiction of Jews as monsters and the creative use of monstrous beings in Jewish culture. Jews have occupied a liminal position within European society and culture, being deeply immersed yet outsiders to it. For this reason, they were perceived in terms of otherness and were often represented as monstrous beings. However, at the same time, European Jews invoked, with tantalizing ubiquity, images of magical, terrifying and hybrid beings in their texts, art and folktales. These images were used by Jewish authors and artists to push back against their own identification as monstrous or diabolical and to tackle concerns about religious persecution, assimilation and acculturation, gender and sexuality, science and technology and the rise of antisemitism. Bringing together an impressive cast of contributors from around the world, this fascinating volume is an invaluable resource for academics, postgraduates and advanced undergraduates interested in Jewish studies, as well as the history of monsters.""-",2019,6/11/20 18:50,6/11/20 18:50,,,,,,,,,,,,,Bloomsbury,London,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,,,,,,,"Idelson-Shein, Iris; Wiese, Christian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,Monsters and monstrosity in Jewish history: from the Middle Ages to modernity

266,,"Michelson, David A.",2019,,,,,"This article examines the impact which Peter R.L Brown’s half century of scholarship has made on the historiography of Christianity. This article surveys five recurring motifs or theoretical approaches to Christianization which epitomize Brown’s interpretive method as an historian of Christianity: Christianization as social change, Christianization as continuity, Christianization as revolution, Christianization as simultaneously diverse and universal, and Christianization as unfamiliar. Individually, these themes challenge monolithic interpretations of “Christianization” in Late Antiquity. Taken as a whole, these themes reflect Brown’s emphasis on the paradoxical aspects of Christianity in Late Antiquity. As Brown himself has put it, his goal in constantly overturning scholarly assumptions about Christianization was to achieve “a sense of the salutary vertigo” in which the historian encounters ancient Christianity with “the same combination of wonder and respect that makes for fruitful travel in a foreign land.”",2019,7/27/21 22:40,6/30/22 18:45,7/27/21 22:40,,,,,,,“Salutary Vertigo”,Études Byzantines et Post Byzantines,"new series, vol.

Careful reading of texts, inscriptions, coins and other archaeological materials allow the reader to examine how religious practice in Philippi changed as the city moved from being a Hellenistic polis to a Roman colony to a center for Christian worship and pilgrimage. The essays raise questions about traditional understandings of material culture in Philippi, and come to conclusions that reflect more complicated and diverse views of the city and its inhabitants.

Once implacable theological foes, the two traditions have travelled a great distance in coming to view the other with respect and dignity. Responding to the horrors of Auschwitz, the Catholic Church has undergone a “reckoning of the soul,” beginning with its landmark document Nostra Aetate and embraced a positive theology of Judaism including the ongoing validity of the Jewish covenant. Jews have responded to this unprecedented outreach, especially in the document Dabru Emet. Together, these two Abrahamic traditions have begun seeking a repair of the world. The road has been rocky and certainly obstacles remain. Nevertheless, authentic interfaith dialogue remains a new and promising development in the search for a peace.",12/23/14,11/3/16 20:10,11/3/16 20:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lexington Books,,en,,,,,Google Books,,,,,https://books.google.com/books?id=JT3xBQAAQBAJ,,Religion / Christianity / History; Religion / Comparative Religion; Religion / Judaism / History,"Berger, Alan L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,"Post-Holocaust Jewish–Christian Dialogue: After the Flood, before the Rainbow"

Power, like religion, is in collaboration. Along this line, this book affirms that one could see and study the power structures and power relations of a religion in and through the missions of empires. Empires rise and roam with the blessings and protections of religious power structures (e.g., scriptures, theologies, interpretations, traditions) that in return carry, propagate and justify imperial agendas. Thus, to understand the relation between religion and power requires one to also study the relation between religion and empires. Christianity is the religion that receives the most deliberation in this book, with some attention to power structures and power relations in Hinduism and Buddhism. The cross-cultural and inter-national contributors share the conviction that something within each religion resists and subverts its power structures and collaborations. The authors discern and interrogate the involvements of religion with empires past and present, political and ideological, economic and customary, systemic and local. The upshot is that the book troubles religious teachings and practices that sustain, as well as profit from, empires."" --",2019,8/18/21 18:16,8/18/21 18:17,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Havea, Jione; Cowan, Collin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,Religion and power

344,,"Floyd-Thomas, Stacey",2020,978-1-978711-37-2,,,,"In 'Resisting Occupation', international scholars discuss the radical denial of human flourishing caused by the occupation of mind, body, spirit, and land. They explore how religious perspectives can be, and often are, constructed by occupiers to justify their actions, perpetuate exploitation, and domesticate indigenous landholders. In the name of Christianization and civilization, which has proven to be a global phenomenon beyond time and space, a consistent domestication process is established. The colonized are taught to want, to yearn for, and to embrace their occupation, seeing themselves through the eyes of their colonizers. Writing from different spots around the globe, the scholars of this book demonstrate how occupation, a synonym for empire, is manifested within their social context and reveal unity in their struggle for liberation. Recognizing that where there is oppression, there is resistance, the contributors turn to religion.

Most Americans did not know much, if anything, about Edwards until decades after his death, when various-often conflicting-views of Edwards appeared. New Divinity ministers expanded his theological vison while revivalists, including Charles G. Finney, enlisted Edwards’s legacy for their purposes, and thousands of evangelicals embraced Edwards’s Life of David Brainerd. Edwards intrigued (and offended) writers like Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe, and his condemnation of sin caught the interest of antislavery advocates in the Civil War. His legacy helped to shape the rise of American literature as a discipline, leading to the widespread academic study of Edwards that exploded in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, with over 5000 books, dissertations, articles, and theses published on Edwards. © Oxford University Press 2021.",2021,11/22/22 17:33,11/22/22 17:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\DPWUC6V2\display.html,,,American civil war; Charles G. finney; David brainerd; Evangelicalism; Harriet beecher stowe; Mark twain; New divinity; Revival,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,The Oxford Handbook of Jonathan Edwards

Reflections by Nancy McWilliams,David Wallin, and Salman Akhtar are responded to by scholars representing a substantial range of psychological, spiritual, religious, and theological perspectives. The ensuing scholarly, clinical dialogue advances the idea that a psychotherapist’s formative spiritual experiences and core values both deeply influence and are simultaneously influenced by the therapeutic relationships and healing work that constitute his or her clinical practice. Through this addressing of the interplay between these master clinicians’ inner wisdom and the therapeutic process, readers will see demonstrated firsthand the vital importance of the psychotherapist’s spiritual life for creative and effective clinical work. This volume will also provide the opportunity for both experienced and training psychotherapists to enrich their own clinical practice via a more robust engagement in the points of contact and resonance that exist between their work with clients and their own unique spiritual lives and experiences.",9/24/14,10/30/14 19:13,11/18/14 22:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rowman & Littlefield Publishers,Lanham,English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/The-Skillful-Soul-Psychotherapist-Spirituality/dp/1442234482,,,"Stavros, George S.; Sandage, Steven J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,The Skillful Soul of the Psychotherapist: The Link between Spirituality and Clinical Excellence
449,,"Levine, Amy-Jill",2019,978-90-429-3911-0,,,,"The second half of the 20th century witnessed unprecedented enthusiasm for inner-Christian ecumenical dialogue as well as Christian-Jewish dialogue. However, at the time of the transition from the 20th to the 21st century the dialogues were marked by disillusionment and disappointment due to the fact that not enough progress was experienced with regard to concrete everyday issues. Moreover theoretical points of disagreement remained obstacles for a real mutual understanding, the major ones being the interpretation of certain Biblical passages (esp. John 14:6 and 15:26) and their implications for Christology and the theology of the Trinity. This book explores ""new hermeneutics for renewed dialogues."" To use a metaphor found in the book, the contributions of this volume are suggesting ""new songs"" with regard to the dialogues by proposing a future-oriented hermeneutics and a shift from an exclusive focus on Christology to including Pneumatology and thus the doctrine of the Trinity. By so doing the authors and editors intend to offer a new impetus and a new elan in Roman Catholic-Eastern Orthodox as well as Christian-Jewish dialogues. The co-authors of this book contribute pneumatological hermeneutical insights from their respective Protestant, (Christian) Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Jewish perspectives.",4/26/19,6/11/20 18:53,6/11/20 18:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,Peeters,,en,Could not import appropiate citation from library website,,,,Google Books,,,,,https://books.google.com/books?id=d5WyxQEACAAJ,,,"Bieringer, Reimund; Ibita, Ma Marilou S.; Mey, Peter De; Pollefeyt, Didier",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,"The Spirit, Hermeneutics, and Dialogues"

In this book fifty leading theologians, scholars, and pastoral leaders offer their own assessment of the meaning of the Council, in many cases drawing on their personal experience as witnesses or participants. The contributors are a who s- who of modern Catholic voices: Francis Murphy (who, as Xavier Rynne, penned an inside account of the Council for The New Yorker, Lisa Sowle Cahill, John O Malley, Joan Chittister, Gregory Baum, Michael Novak, Basil Pennington, Richard McBrien, Cardinal Avery Dulles, John Dominic Crossan, Joseph Komonchak, Brother Roger of TaizÃ©, Cardinal Francis Arinze, Elizabeth Johnson, David Hollenbach, and many more. Beginning with an overview of the Council in context, successive chapters cover the liturgy; the understanding of the church; revelation, scripture, and tradition; ecumenism and interreligious dialogue; world issues and social justice. Many of the stories provide behind-the-scenes details of what went on at the Council as well as what went on in the lives of those it affected. For those who want to understand what happened at the Council, as well as those concerned about the state of the church today and the agenda for the future, these fifty personal stories provide an invaluable, and inspiring resource.",7/25/12,10/30/14 15:34,10/30/14 15:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,Orbis Books,"Maryknoll, NY",English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/Vatican-II-Fifty-Personal-Stories/dp/1570759936,,,"Madges, William; Daley, Michael J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,Vatican II: Fifty Personal Stories

The setting for the meeting, interestingly enough, was a summer academic program where we lived intimately with several prolific academic couples. At the dawn of both of our graduate careers, having such exposure to couples who were able successfully to integrate their personal, professional, and philosophical selves allowed us to observe, critique, and imagine that such a pairing might be not only possible but also attractive. © 2001 by Elizabeth G.

526,,"Lim, Paul",2008,,,,,"In 1564, or thereabouts, the English discovered a new term of abuse - 'Puritan'. Initially, it was an insult launched at nonconformist clergy within the newly reformed Elizabethan church, zealous Protestants who refused to wear prescribed liturgical vestments, particularly the white surplice, and who gained a reputation as 'opposers of the hierarchy and church-service'. But soon the nickname was taken up by 'profane mouths', who deployed it rather indiscriminately 'to abuse pious people'. 'Puritan' became a handy smear word for bishops angered by clerical nonconformity, metropolitan playwrights provoked by censorious moralism, and villagers driven to distraction by assaults on traditional festive culture. By the early seventeenth century, Patrick Collinson explains, 'Puritanism' had become 'the brand name for a certain kind of Protestant religiosity, social conduct and politics'. The polemical origins of the term have troubled historians, and led some to call for the abolition of Puritanism as a historical category. Yet for most scholars of early modern England and New England, the concept has proved indispensable. As the American historian Michael Winship explains, Puritanism is 'an extremely convenient shorthand term', but one that 'is unavoidably a contextual, imprecise term, not an objective one, a term to use carefully but not take too seriously in itself'. Defining Puritanism has become a favourite parlour game for early modern historians. Some readers will be familiar with the discussion, but others may appreciate some basic orientation. The chapters in this collection offer different perspectives and approaches to the problem of definition, and together they build up a multifaceted picture of our subject. But we can begin by locating Puritans on the map of sixteenth and seventeenth-century European Christianity. © Cambridge University Press 2008.",2008,11/22/22 20:52,11/22/22 20:52,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\PA59CEKG\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,The Cambridge Companion to: Puritanism
