Life in first-century Palestine was very different from our world today, and many traditional interpretations of Jesus' stories ignore this disparity and have often allowed anti-Semitism and misogyny to color their perspectives.In Short Stories by Jesus, Amy-Jill Levine analyzes these ""problems with parables"" taking readers back in time to understand how their original Jewish audience understood them. With this revitalized understanding, she interprets these moving stories for the contemporary reader, showing how the parables are not just about Jesus, but are also about us—and when read rightly, still challenge and provoke us two thousand years later.The Leader Guide contains everything needed to guide a group through the six-week study including session plans, activities, and discussion questions, as well as multiple format options.",5/15/18,6/11/20 18:53,6/11/20 18:53,,,66,,,,,Short Stories by Jesus Leader Guide,,,,,Abingdon Press,,English,,,,,Amazon,,Amazon was the only way to get a complete citation to Zotero,,,https://www.amazon.com/Short-Stories-Jesus-Leader-Guide-ebook/dp/B074KM3G83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,Short Stories by Jesus Leader Guide: The Enigmatic Parables of a Controversial Rabbi,

Where, then, are Americans finding meaning in their lives, if not in the context of traditional religion? In this provocative study, the authors argue that the objects of our attention have become our god and fulfilling our desires has become our religion. They examine the religious dimensions of six specific aspects of American culture - body and sex, big business, entertainment, politics, sports, and science and technology - that function as ""altars"" where Americans gather to worship and produce meaning for their lives. The Altars Where We Worship shows how these secular altars provide resources for understanding the self, others, and the world itself. ""For better or worse,"" the authors write, ""we are faced with the reality that human experiences before these altars contain religious characteristics in common with experiences before more traditional altars."" Readers will come away with a clearer understanding of what religion is after exploring the thoroughly religious aspects of popular culture in the United States. - from publisher., $$Cbibliography_note$$VIncludes bibliographical references and index.",2016,2/13/18 19:00,2/13/18 19:00,,,,,,,,The altars where we worship,,,,,Westminster John Knox Press,"Louisville, Kentucky",eng,,,,,discoverlibrary.vanderbilt.edu,BR115 .C8 F563 2016,,,,,,United States; Christianity and culture United States; Christianity and culture; nne United States Popular culture; Popular culture; Popular culture Religious aspects Christianity; Popular culture United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,First edition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,The altars where we worship: the religious significance of popular culture,

This is the first book to gather the available ancient Near Eastern, extra-biblical sources containing prophetic words or references to prophetic activities. Among the 140 texts included in this volume are oracles of prophets, personal letters, formal inscriptions, and administrative documents from ancient Mesopotamia and Levant from the second and first millennia B.C.E. Most of the texts come from Mari and Assyria. In addition, the volume provides new translations of the relevant section of the Egyptian Report of Wenamon, by Robert K. Ritner, and of various texts from Syria-Palestine containing allusions to prophets and prophetic activities, by C.L. Seow. By collecting and presenting evidence of the activities of prophets and the phenomenon of prophecy from all over the ancient Near East, the volume illumines the cultural background of biblical prophecy and its parallels. It provides scholars of the history, religions, and cultural traditions of the ancient Near East with important information about different types and forms of transmissions of divine words, and makes these valuable primary source materials accessible to students and general readers in contemporary English along with transcriptions of the original languages, indexes, and extensive bibliography.",2003,10/10/14 19:35,11/15/22 20:34,,,273,,,,,,Writings from the ancient world,12,,,Society of Biblical Literature,"Atlanta, GA",English,,,,,OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch,,,,,,,Histoire.

These include the ordination of homosexuals and the blessing of homosexual unions, as well as broader issues dealing with liturgical and theological language about God and the role of the church in a pluralistic society. The contributors speak of these various issues as theological educators, ministers, and committed Christians. They ask, What do the scriptures say about homosexuality and related issues? How should the scriptures inform our theological reflection? and How do we live faithfully in regard to this matter? And like the Christian community at large, the contributors are not of one mind on any of these issues; many times they are in considerable disagreement. Homosexuality and Christian Community will help to guide churches and individuals engaged in theological reflection about the place of homosexuals in the church.",1996,10/10/14 19:35,10/10/14 19:45,,,159,,,,,,,,,,Westminster John Knox Press,"Louisville, Ky.",English,,,,,OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch,,,,,,,Religious aspects; Christianity; Biblical teaching.

Her special interests have lain, first, in the modern literary criticism of the Hebrew Bible, where her key work was Tragedy and Biblical Narrative: Arrows of the Almighty. Asecond area has been feminist criticism of the Hebrew Bible; here her notable contributions were Fragmented Women: Feminist (Sub)versions of Biblical Narratives and Plotted, Shot, and Painted: Cultural Representations of Biblical Women. A more recent, and now almost favourite, theme is the Bible and cultural studies, especially the Bible and art. Key works here have been a series of edited volumes, such as Beyond the Biblical Horizon: The Bible and the Arts, and The Bible in Film / The Bible and Film. Her fourth area of continuing interest has been the Song of Songs, with many articles culminating in her perceptive commentary in the Old Testament Library series. In this rich volume, 25 of her friends and colleagues offer her papers on all these themes. Several are on or around the Song of Songs (Graeme Auld, Fiona Black, David Clines, Sara Japhet, Martti Nissinen, Yair Zakovitch), and topics of feminist interest (Yairah Amit, Athalya Brenner, Claudia Camp, Hugh Pyper, Jack Sasson). Cultural studies are represented by Alice Bach, Hans Barstad, Andrew Davies, David Gunn, Martin O'Kane, John Sawyer and Ellen van Wolde, and literary criticism by Michael Fox, Edwin Good, Norman Gottwald, Edward Greenstein, Francis Landy, Burke Long and Hugh Williamson.",2011-11,12/11/14 21:12,12/11/14 21:14,,333-355,,,,,,,,,,,Sheffield Phoenix Press Ltd,"Sheffield, England",Inglese,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.it/Critical-Engagement-Essays-Hebrew-Honour/dp/1907534334,,,"Clines, David J.

The authors, representing Wesleyan backgrounds in this volume, all hold concern for a suffering world, believing that socioeconomic systems, prescribed roles, stereotypes, or power differentials cannot dictate normative destinies for persons or for living systems. Each writer calls for movement from suffering to surviving to thriving in the midst of discussions about how alienation, in a variety of contexts, can be transformed into connection and reconnection through intentional shifts in circumstance and human agency. A hermeneutic of healing and justice focused on human relationship with the environment, economic and social systems that disconnect and reconnect, socio-cultural and economic constructs that divide or heal, encountered difference that brings opportunity, and various manifestations of personal pain that can turn to hope, provides a significant, realistic alternative to suffering and alienation. Meaningful connection to each other and to the earth through the alleviation of suffering provides hope for the integrity and future of humankind and the healing of the planet. This book is an offering to those who are called to work for change and a challenge to those who do not believe that change should or could happen. Alienation is not the final word.

He attributes this shift, and an accompanying deterioration of social well-being, to neoliberal capitalism’s villainization of the less fortunate and promotion of a “survival of the fittest” mentality. This introduction provides a preview of the ways in which neoliberalism has compromised the social fabric, leading to an erosion of community and growing economic inequality. Drawing from his allegiance to the working class and commitment to the care of souls tradition, Rogers-Vaughn calls for a post-capitalist revision of pastoral care and theology that emphasizes social and political conditions, rather than individual decisions and behaviors, as the root of human suffering.",2016,8/18/21 19:31,8/18/21 19:31,8/18/21 19:31,1-34,,,,,,Introduction,New Approaches to Religion and Power,,,,Palgrave Macmillan US,New York,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1057/978-1-137-55339-3_1,,,,,Pastoral Care; Census Tract; Child Poverty; Economic Inequality; Pastoral Theology,"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,Introduction: Preface to a Post-Capitalist Pastoral Theology,Caring for Souls in a Neoliberal Age

In this book Bonnie J. Miller-McLemore shows how this trend in scholarship has led to an expanded subject matter, alternative ways of knowing, and richer terms for analysis in doing Christian theology. Tracing more than two decades of her own search for a more inclusive discipline -- one that truly grapples with theology in the midst of life -- Christian Theology in Practice shows not only where Miller-McLemore herself has traveled in the field but also how pastoral and practical theology has developed during this time. Looking forward, Miller-McLemore calls on the academy and Christian congregations to disrupt conventional theological boundaries and to acknowledge the multiplicity of shapes and places in which the ""wisdom of God"" appears.",2012,10/14/14 2:04,8/25/20 15:41,,1-21,,,,,,,,,,,William B.

In this new challenging modus, religion raises questions about identity, power, rationality, subjectivity, law and safety, but above all: religion questions, contests and even blurs the borders between the public and the private. These phenomena urge to rethink what are often considered to be clear differences between religions, between the public and the private and between the religious and the secular.

2SN73SZT,"Segovia, Fernando F.",2018,"Segovia, Fernando F",,,,https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/handle/10523/8558,"A key principle in the work of Latin American liberation theologians has been a willingness to take their Latin American social context seriously as an aid for understanding biblical texts. This paper is intended to illustrate the value of this principle by focussing on some disturbing points in the gospel accounts of crucifixion in the light of recent accounts of torture and terror in Latin America. It argues that documentation of torture and abuse in Latin American military regimes can illuminate neglected aspects of Jesus’ passion presented in the gospels. Most importantly this involves recognition that crucifixion was a form of torture that served a wider purpose than execution and was used to demonstrate the state’s power and terrorise those who might oppose it. Within this framework, one issue in the horror of Jesus torture and crucifixion which has been completely neglected in Christian tradition—the degree of sexual abuse that it involved—can be addressed honestly and openly. My central contention is that crucifixion in the ancient world carried a strongly sexual element and should be understood as a form of sexual abuse. The gospels indicate that Jesus was subjected to a high degree of sexual humiliation and was possibly a victim of sexual assault. The final part of this paper suggests the constructive purposes that the acknowledgement of this sexual abuse might serve.",2018,8/25/21 19:43,8/25/21 19:45,8/25/21 19:43,,,,,,,"Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse",,,,,"Centre for Theology and Public Issues, University of Otago",,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,,,,ourarchive.otago.ac.nz,,Accepted: 2018-11-08T19:41:43Z,,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\DEU449E9\Tombs - 2018 - Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse Text .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\3LSRUH76\8558.html",,,,,,,,,"Tombs, David John",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,Jesus as Victim of State Terror: A Critical Reflection Twenty Years Later,"Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse: Text and Context"

From the Introduction: “The heartbeat of this book is its concern to reimagine interreligious dialogue as a “dialogue of and for life” by interlinking it with liberation. What drives it is a passion that seeks to hold together two distinct concerns that emerged within theological thinking during the latter half of the 20th century and have since freed theological imagination in manifold ways.”",,6/28/22 20:39,6/28/22 20:42,6/28/22 20:39,,,,,,,,,,,,World Council of Churches,,en,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\6L2LNTRL\faiths-seeking-justice.html,,,,Peniel Jesudason Rufus Rajkumar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,Interreligious Dialogue beyond Dialogue: Revisiting Truth and Power from a Christian Perspective under the Conditions of Empire,Faith(s) Seeking Justice World Council of Churches

During this historical epoch, traditions about Israel and Judah's founding became fixed as markers of ethnic identity, and much of the canonical Hebrew Bible came into its present form.  Concentrating on these events, a clearer historical picture emerges. The entire volume is set within the context of Doug Knight's contributions, which have encouraged a rigorous social-scientific and tradition-historical approach to the Hebrew Bible and ancient Israel in general.  Many scholars have pursued how the social scientific method, first used to analyze early monarchic Israel, can shape the understanding of these later historical periods.  Knight's methods, teachings, writings, and scholarly interventions have pointed the contributors of this volume to fresh considerations of the Persian and Hellenistic periods.  The concluding essay will examine the future directions in which such sociological and historical investigation can go forward.",2012,12/11/14 20:57,5/1/15 14:40,,2-18,,,,,,,Library of Hebrew Bible Old Testament studies,,,,Bloomsbury T&T Clark,London,English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/dp/0567656284/ref=asc_df_05676562843445708?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&tag=pg-1583-86-20&linkCode=df0&creative=395097&creativeASIN=0567656284,,,"Berquist, Jon L.; Hunt, Alice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reprint edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,Another look at the tenth commandment,Focusing Biblical Studies: The Crucial Nature of the Persian and Hellenistic Periods: Essays in Honor of Douglas A.

ITC envisioned itself as providing rigorous and relevant theological education that would enable Black churches and their communities to seize this new horizon. ITC would serve the age by preparing clergy to lead Black communities and their churches. As important as ITC’s history was in influencing my decision to enroll, so was my own family heritage. Long before the constituent schools came together, Gammon Theological Seminary, one of ITC’s parent institutions, had trained Black clergy for almost a century. So for ITC, the mission that began in 1958 did not end with the era of civil rights gains; it only adapted to the changing landscape of racialization. Indeed, ITC’s commitment to educate leaders extended to the entire Black church, and its many communities, not simply to those whom the church had historically privileged. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",2016,11/22/22 20:55,11/22/22 20:55,,124-132,,,,,,A liberating spirituality,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,DOI: 10.4324/9781315648859,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\5XYDW9JL\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,A liberating spirituality: Evaluating theological education at a black graduate school,Graduate Education at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs): A Student Perspective

PMMTKZML,"Levine, Amy-Jill",2007,"Levine, A.-J.",978-1-932792-72-0,,,,"The third gospel's presentation of the Pharisees is ""puzzling,"" 1 lacking consistency,2 ""complex,"" 3 and ""disputed.""4 Whether approached primarily by literary or by historical questions, Luke's Pharisees elude clear answers. The reasons for this confusion are several, of which the following four are major. First, the relationship between this gospel and the Acts of the Apostles, Luke's second volume, complicates assessment of figures that appear in both texts. Pharisees in Acts include Gamaliel, ""a teacher of the Law, respected by all the people,"" Gamaliel's student Paul, ""a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees"" (5:34; 23:6), ""believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees"" (15:5), and ""the scribes of the Pharisees' group"" (23:9). However, the Pharisees in Acts similarly elude definitive assessment: is Gamaliel admirable because he cautions against persecuting Jesus' followers or the villainous mentor of the arch-persecutor Paul? Do Pharisees demonstrate Scriptural fidelity or do they block the Holy Spirit by insisting Gentile Christians follow the Mosaic Law? Moreover, their depictions impact any assessment of the Gospel of Luke if one seeks a consistent presentation.5 Second, source-critical questions remain uncertain. Most New Testament scholars propose that Luke relied on both Mark's gospel and a (hypothetical) source shared with Matthew, labeled Q. A minority of scholars argue that Luke directly depended on Matthew and that Mark is a conflation of Matthew and Luke. Assessment of Luke's sources impacts understanding of Luke's Pharisees. Assessed in terms of Markan priority, Luke adds references to Pharisees in 5:17; 7:30; 7:36; 11:53; 13:31; 14:1, 3; 16:14; 17:20; and 18:10-14. Compared to Mark and Matthew, Luke highlights the Pharisees' love of money and their rejection of Jesus' association with tax collectors and sinners. But Luke lacks the odd Matthean (27:62) combination of ""chief priests and Pharisees,"" for Luke mentions no Pharisees in the Passion narrative. Absent is Mark's note that the chief priests, scribes, and elders (Mark 11:27) sent ""Pharisees and Herodians"" (12:13) to trap Jesus; Luke speaks only of ""spies"" who pretended to be righteous (dikaivou~; 20:20). Did Luke suppress this information? Was Luke aware of it? Third, Luke's historical and social contexts remain speculative. The Pharisees may represent ""Jewish Christians"" of Luke's own day.6 Or, they may be ahistorical foils designed to teach the author's audience by negative example. The invectives may be conventional (hypocrites, lovers of money), with no basis in reality. Or, they may reflect the redactor's use of sources, themselves of unclear historical worth. Nor are these options mutually exclusive. Further complicating this issue: scholars have yet to reach any firm agreement on the composition of the intended audience or the identity of the author: Gentile (the most common identification), proselyte, God-fearer, Jew. Finally, all readers bring to the text their own presuppositions and values. Some interpreters find Pharisaic presence implied where Luke mentions none and ascribe to Pharisees implied concerns that Luke does not note. Some begin with the view that all Pharisees are the same; others conclude that these figures should be assessed as individuals, like the Gentiles and the Twelve.7 In recognition of such considerations, this essay takes the following steps. First, it looks at Luke's gospel apart from Acts. Second, it does not emphasize possible redactional changes. Third, eschewing reconstruction of Luke's social context, it focuses on the narrative: what the gospel's Pharisees do and how the narrator describes them. Finally, to enable readers to assess the data themselves, it addresses each pericope in which the Pharisees appear rather than organizing the information into categories, such as ""Sabbath observance,"" ""economic status,"" or ""table fellowship"". © 2007 by Baylor University Press.",2007,11/22/22 20:34,11/22/22 20:34,,113-130,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\FY49QK65\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,Luke's pharisees,In Quest of the Historical Pharisees

Less well known is that the film contains references to what was, at the time of its release, cutting edge biblical scholarship and Life of Jesus research. This research, founded on the acceptance of the Historical Jesus as a Jew who needs to be understood within the context of his time, is implicitly referenced through the setting of the Brian character within a tumultuous social and political background. This collection is a compilation of essays from foremost scholars of the historical Jesus and the first century Judaea, and includes contributions from George Brooke, Richard Burridge, Paula Fredriksen, Steve Mason, Adele Reinhartz, Bart Ehrman, Amy-Jill Levine, James Crossley, Philip Davies, Joan Taylor, Bill Telford, Helen Bond, Guy Steibel, David Tollerton, David Shepherd and Katie Turner.

In medieval times, spiritual direction was common in the Roman Catholic monastic traditions. It extended significantly into Protestant Christianity in the late twentieth century by predominantly white and affluent organizations. Spiritual direction has progressively become a global, multi-religious and interfaith practice. This book is a comprehensive and concise text from a spiritual director of color, offering inclusive resources and tools to spiritual directors of many faiths and for people of diverse cultures and traditions. Core skills such a deep listening, hospitality, and discernment are presented with cutting-edge lessons on internal liberation, systemic trauma, and imaginative discovery. Spiritual direction is taught by more than 100 educational institutions and spirituality centers in the US alone, but typical curriculum generally does not reflect current cultural reality and growing diversity.

Floyd-Thomas’s chapter, “The Good, the m.A.A.d., and the Holy: Kendrick Lamar’s Meditations on Sin and Moral Agency in the Post-Gangsta Era,” examines the ways in which Lamar grapples with notions of sin on both an individual and a communal basis within the African American experience. Here Floyd-Thomas argues the most consistent and unwavering facet of Lamar’s work has been his incisive commentary and musing on the cumulative impact immoral and ‘illicit’ acts have had on his generation born and raised in the shadow of gangsta rap’s emergence within the global cultural milieu. Exploring the relevance of ‘West Coast’ sensibilities as fomenters of Lamar’s interest in morality, alongside thorough analysis drawing parallels with St. Augustine, Floyd-Thomas presents Lamar as a marker of the contemporary complexities concerning making right-action in a world with so little of it and leaves readers with the impression that, at the very least, Lamar is honest enough to help navigate the moral terrain. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Christopher M.

Among the first to bring a focus of scholarly attention to the period of ancient Israel's creativity after the Exile, she has also been a leader in foregrounding the Jewish tradition within the interpretative discourse of biblical scholars. And as a woman scholar, she has advanced the study of issues in the Hebrew Bible that impinge on the concerns of women ancient and modern. Tamara Eskenazi was awarded the 2008 National Jewish Book Award for her volume The Torah: A Women's Commentary and the 2011 National Jewish Book Award in Women's Studies for her commentary on Ruth in the Jewish Publication Society Bible Commentary series. The 26 articles offered to Tamara Eskenazi by her friends in this volume represent the range of her interests in all things biblical and Jewish. From Genesis to the New Testament to modern Hebrew fiction, from technical studies on the prophets or Qumran to penetrating insights on her beloved philosopher Levinas, this volume beautifully represents the range and depth of Jewish culture.

Drawing on Jewish history, literary studies, folklore, art history and the history of science, it examines both the historical depiction of Jews as monsters and the creative use of monstrous beings in Jewish culture. Jews have occupied a liminal position within European society and culture, being deeply immersed yet outsiders to it. For this reason, they were perceived in terms of otherness and were often represented as monstrous beings. However, at the same time, European Jews invoked, with tantalizing ubiquity, images of magical, terrifying and hybrid beings in their texts, art and folktales. These images were used by Jewish authors and artists to push back against their own identification as monstrous or diabolical and to tackle concerns about religious persecution, assimilation and acculturation, gender and sexuality, science and technology and the rise of antisemitism. Bringing together an impressive cast of contributors from around the world, this fascinating volume is an invaluable resource for academics, postgraduates and advanced undergraduates interested in Jewish studies, as well as the history of monsters.""-",2019,6/11/20 18:50,6/11/20 18:50,,251-64,,,,,,,,,,,Bloomsbury,London/New York,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1105060702,,,,,,"Idelson-Shein, Iris; Wiese, Christian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,‘Der Volf’ or the Jew as Out(side of the)law,Monsters and monstrosity in Jewish history: from the Middle Ages to modernity

This article surveys five recurring motifs or theoretical approaches to Christianization which epitomize Brown’s interpretive method as an historian of Christianity: Christianization as social change, Christianization as continuity, Christianization as revolution, Christianization as simultaneously diverse and universal, and Christianization as unfamiliar. Individually, these themes challenge monolithic interpretations of “Christianization” in Late Antiquity. Taken as a whole, these themes reflect Brown’s emphasis on the paradoxical aspects of Christianity in Late Antiquity. As Brown himself has put it, his goal in constantly overturning scholarly assumptions about Christianization was to achieve “a sense of the salutary vertigo” in which the historian encounters ancient Christianity with “the same combination of wonder and respect that makes for fruitful travel in a foreign land.”",2019,7/27/21 22:40,6/30/22 18:45,7/27/21 22:40,45-70,,,,,,“Salutary Vertigo”,Études Byzantines et Post Byzantines,"new series, vol.

Careful reading of texts, inscriptions, coins and other archaeological materials allow the reader to examine how religious practice in Philippi changed as the city moved from being a Hellenistic polis to a Roman colony to a center for Christian worship and pilgrimage. The essays raise questions about traditional understandings of material culture in Philippi, and come to conclusions that reflect more complicated and diverse views of the city and its inhabitants.

Once implacable theological foes, the two traditions have travelled a great distance in coming to view the other with respect and dignity. Responding to the horrors of Auschwitz, the Catholic Church has undergone a “reckoning of the soul,” beginning with its landmark document Nostra Aetate and embraced a positive theology of Judaism including the ongoing validity of the Jewish covenant. Jews have responded to this unprecedented outreach, especially in the document Dabru Emet. Together, these two Abrahamic traditions have begun seeking a repair of the world. The road has been rocky and certainly obstacles remain. Nevertheless, authentic interfaith dialogue remains a new and promising development in the search for a peace.",12/23/14,11/3/16 20:10,11/3/16 20:11,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lexington Books,,en,,,,,Google Books,,Google-Books-ID: JT3xBQAAQBAJ,,,https://books.google.com/books?id=JT3xBQAAQBAJ,,Religion / Christianity / History; Religion / Comparative Religion; Religion / Judaism / History,"Berger, Alan L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,Speaking of the Middle East: Jews and Christians in Dialogue and Dispute,"Post-Holocaust Jewish–Christian Dialogue: After the Flood, before the Rainbow"

Power, like religion, is in collaboration. Along this line, this book affirms that one could see and study the power structures and power relations of a religion in and through the missions of empires. Empires rise and roam with the blessings and protections of religious power structures (e.g., scriptures, theologies, interpretations, traditions) that in return carry, propagate and justify imperial agendas. Thus, to understand the relation between religion and power requires one to also study the relation between religion and empires. Christianity is the religion that receives the most deliberation in this book, with some attention to power structures and power relations in Hinduism and Buddhism. The cross-cultural and inter-national contributors share the conviction that something within each religion resists and subverts its power structures and collaborations. The authors discern and interrogate the involvements of religion with empires past and present, political and ideological, economic and customary, systemic and local. The upshot is that the book troubles religious teachings and practices that sustain, as well as profit from, empires."" --",2019,8/18/21 18:16,8/18/21 18:17,,71-84,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1079410249,,,,,,,,,,,"Havea, Jione; Cowan, Collin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,"Empire, Deep Solidarity, and the Future of Resistance",Religion and power

The particular dynamics emerging from the coronavirus pandemic have been felt most intensely by America’s most vulnerable populations, who are disproportionately people of color and the working poor, the people whom the Bible refers to as “the least of these.” This book makes the case that the pandemic was not just a medical phenomenon, or an economic or social one, but also a religious one. Religious practice has been altered in profound ways. Controversies around religious freedom have been re-ignited over debates concerning whether government can restrict church services. Christian white supremacists not only defied shelter in place orders, but found new ways to propagate racist attacks, with their White Christian identity fueling their reactions to the pandemic. Some religious leaders, including those in communities of color, saw the virus as an indicator of God’s wrath, or as a divine test, and viewed altering their traditional practices to mitigate the virus’s spread as a weakening of faith. Religion, Race, and COVID-19 argues that there is a religious hierarchy in US society that puts “the least of these” last while prioritizing those who benefit most from white privilege. Yet these vulnerable populations draw on theological and religious resources to contend with these existential threats. The volume shows how social transformation occurs when faith is both formed and informed during crises, offering compelling insight into the saliency and lasting impact of religiosity within human culture.",2/7/22,6/28/22 16:43,6/28/22 16:44,6/28/22 16:27,1-14,,,,,,,,,,,New York University Press,,en,,,,,www-degruyter-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu,,"DOI: 10.18574/nyu/9781479810277.001.0001 Publication Title: Religion, Race, and COVID-19",,,,,Racism; Neoliberalism; Rhetoric; Black Church; Religion; Race; Theology; Genocide; Nihilism; Paul; Redemption; Theodicy; Womanism; Saul; African American; COVID-19; American Christianity; American Indian; Anthropodicy; beloved community; Black faith; Black women; Brian Kemp; Comedy; conscientization; Coronavirus; Covid-19; Damascus Road; Digital faith; dog whistle politics; Donald Trump; Evangelical; evangelicals; fundamentalists; Humanism; hypervisibility; Intersectionality; Invisible institution; masks; Microhistory; Millennial; millennials; Necropolitics; Pandemic; Relief; religious freedom; religious liberty; Reservation; salvation; Sanctuary movement; Sean Feucht; Stay in place mandate; surveillance; Texas; Treaties; white defiance; White heteropatriarchy; White supremacy; whiteness,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,The Evidence of Things Not Seen: The Twin Viruses of Blind Faith and Color Blindness,"Religion, Race, and COVID-19: Confronting White Supremacy in the Pandemic"

They explore how religious perspectives can be, and often are, constructed by occupiers to justify their actions, perpetuate exploitation, and domesticate indigenous landholders. In the name of Christianization and civilization, which has proven to be a global phenomenon beyond time and space, a consistent domestication process is established. The colonized are taught to want, to yearn for, and to embrace their occupation, seeing themselves through the eyes of their colonizers. Writing from different spots around the globe, the scholars of this book demonstrate how occupation, a synonym for empire, is manifested within their social context and reveal unity in their struggle for liberation. Recognizing that where there is oppression, there is resistance, the contributors turn to religion. While questioning the logic, rationale, theology, and epistemology of the empire?s religion, they nonetheless seek the liberative response of resistance ? at times using the very religion of the occupiers. 0.",2020,6/30/21 16:42,6/30/21 16:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lexington Books,Lexington,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1151889772,,,,,,"Torre, Miguel de la; Raheb, Mitri",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,The Devil that Occupies US: Social Sin and Sacred Silence in a Trumped Era,Resisting occupation.

This was, of course, a fantasy psychoanalyst—and certainly not a useful fantasy. I suspect that for most patients, regardless of their analyst, the first glance exchanged, if not already the first phone call, is filled with me-ness—and her response to me. New patients typically express some surprise that I am a black psychoanalyst. Discovering the meanings associated with this convergence of black and psychoanalyst takes—well, it takes what only time can offer—a relationship. Yes, I am a black psychoanalyst. I am also a black woman; and a “full-bodied” black woman; and a lesbian; and a womanist; and a practical theologian. The late black feminist lesbian poet Pat Parker thought that it would be revolutionary: If I could take all my parts with me when I go somewhere, and not have to say to one of them, ‘No, you stay home tonight, you won’t be welcome,’ because I’m going to an all-white party where I can be gay, but not Black. Or I’m going to a Black poetry reading, and half the poets are anti-homosexual or thousands of situations where something of what I am cannot come with me. The day all the different parts of me can come along, we would have what I would call a revolution.1",2011,8/31/21 16:37,8/31/21 16:37,8/31/21 16:37,81-110,,,,,,Black Psychoanalysis and Black Feminist Psychoanalytic Literary Criticism,Black Religion / Womanist Thought / Social Justice,,,,Palgrave Macmillan US,New York,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1057/9780230118027_5,,,,,Black Woman; Black Church; Black Experience; Psychoanalytic Theory; Racial Content,"Sheppard, Phillis Isabella",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,Black Psychoanalysis and Black Feminist Psychoanalytic Literary Criticism: Resources toward a Critical Appropriation of Psychoanalysis,"Self, Culture, and Others in Womanist Practical Theology"

The Center for Religion and Psychotherapy of Chicago, where I trained, offered a program specializing in the work of Heinz Kohut and the theory he developed, known as self psychology. I was struck by and drawn to what many thought of as Kohut’s radical and necessary shift from Freud’s classical drive model postulating that humanity is primarily motivated by innate sexual and aggressive instincts. Kohut stressed innate developmental needs that we turn to others to meet. The shift from drives leading our way into relationship to needs ultimately produced a view of the person where self-ness emerged out of the experience of satisfaction of crucial needs throughout life. We immediately see that Kohut recognized the importance of early developmental environment, the related needs, and advocated the lifelong need for others—as opposed to a developmental trajectory always toward a radical independence. The aspect of his work that I have found most compelling is where he links culture and self-experience. We will expand these ideas later in the chapter, but I think the following vignette can help us see why a psychoanalytic view of the relationship between culture and self is crucial.",2011,8/31/21 16:36,8/31/21 16:36,8/31/21 16:36,111-125,,,,,,Black Women and Self Psychology,Black Religion / Womanist Thought / Social Justice,,,,Palgrave Macmillan US,New York,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1057/9780230118027_6,,,,,African American Woman; Black Woman; Religious Experience; Psychoanalytic Theory; Selfobject Experience,"Sheppard, Phillis Isabella",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,Black Women and Self Psychology: Toward a Usable Dialogue,"Self, Culture, and Others in Womanist Practical Theology"

The mother is twenty-seven and a graduate student who for eight months of her life used drugs extensively. In an attempt to rescue her daughter from the jaws of a hellish drug addicted life, mother reports her drug use to the department of Children and Family Services. The court places the three-year-old in the care of the grandmother. It is a powerful wake-up call and the young mother enters substance treatment and parenting classes. Everyone is pleased, the grandmother, the social workers, and the court-appointed lawyer for the minor. During the court proceeding, the judge, a middle-aged white male, begins to talk to the little girl about living with her mother again.

The contributors think through different religious traditions to understand and address inequality.

Most Americans did not know much, if anything, about Edwards until decades after his death, when various-often conflicting-views of Edwards appeared. New Divinity ministers expanded his theological vison while revivalists, including Charles G. Finney, enlisted Edwards’s legacy for their purposes, and thousands of evangelicals embraced Edwards’s Life of David Brainerd. Edwards intrigued (and offended) writers like Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe, and his condemnation of sin caught the interest of antislavery advocates in the Civil War. His legacy helped to shape the rise of American literature as a discipline, leading to the widespread academic study of Edwards that exploded in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, with over 5000 books, dissertations, articles, and theses published on Edwards. © Oxford University Press 2021.",2021,11/22/22 17:33,11/22/22 17:33,,463-478,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,DOI: 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198754060.013.34,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\DPWUC6V2\display.html,,,American civil war; Charles G. finney; David brainerd; Evangelicalism; Harriet beecher stowe; Mark twain; New divinity; Revival,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,North America,The Oxford Handbook of Jonathan Edwards

Reflections by Nancy McWilliams,David Wallin, and Salman Akhtar are responded to by scholars representing a substantial range of psychological, spiritual, religious, and theological perspectives. The ensuing scholarly, clinical dialogue advances the idea that a psychotherapist’s formative spiritual experiences and core values both deeply influence and are simultaneously influenced by the therapeutic relationships and healing work that constitute his or her clinical practice. Through this addressing of the interplay between these master clinicians’ inner wisdom and the therapeutic process, readers will see demonstrated firsthand the vital importance of the psychotherapist’s spiritual life for creative and effective clinical work. This volume will also provide the opportunity for both experienced and training psychotherapists to enrich their own clinical practice via a more robust engagement in the points of contact and resonance that exist between their work with clients and their own unique spiritual lives and experiences.",9/24/14,10/30/14 19:13,11/18/14 22:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rowman & Littlefield Publishers,Lanham,English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/The-Skillful-Soul-Psychotherapist-Spirituality/dp/1442234482,,,"Stavros, George S.; Sandage, Steven J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,"Religion--It's Complicated!

However, at the time of the transition from the 20th to the 21st century the dialogues were marked by disillusionment and disappointment due to the fact that not enough progress was experienced with regard to concrete everyday issues. Moreover theoretical points of disagreement remained obstacles for a real mutual understanding, the major ones being the interpretation of certain Biblical passages (esp. John 14:6 and 15:26) and their implications for Christology and the theology of the Trinity. This book explores ""new hermeneutics for renewed dialogues."" To use a metaphor found in the book, the contributions of this volume are suggesting ""new songs"" with regard to the dialogues by proposing a future-oriented hermeneutics and a shift from an exclusive focus on Christology to including Pneumatology and thus the doctrine of the Trinity. By so doing the authors and editors intend to offer a new impetus and a new elan in Roman Catholic-Eastern Orthodox as well as Christian-Jewish dialogues. The co-authors of this book contribute pneumatological hermeneutical insights from their respective Protestant, (Christian) Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Jewish perspectives.",4/26/19,6/11/20 18:53,6/11/20 18:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,Peeters,,en,Could not import appropiate citation from library website,,,,Google Books,,Google-Books-ID: d5WyxQEACAAJ,,,https://books.google.com/books?id=d5WyxQEACAAJ,,,"Bieringer, Reimund; Ibita, Ma Marilou S.; Mey, Peter De; Pollefeyt, Didier",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,"Four Questions on the Trinity, Pneumatology, and Jewish-Christian Relations","The Spirit, Hermeneutics, and Dialogues"

Consequently, major religious traditions form as they come into contact with other religions and cultures, typically in situations of struggle and pressure. Due to neoliberal capitalism, more people are on the move today than ever before. Most are driven by necessity (migration due to violence, poverty, and perceived poverty); others, by religious quests that are often fueled by experiences of tension (pilgrimage). The chapters in this volume explore the complexity of these situations, examining in detail how theology and religion shape up in various contexts ""on the move"" and investigating specific problems and tensions in order to suggest solutions, alternatives, and new possibilities.",2020,8/18/21 17:25,8/18/21 17:29,,1-18,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1202998094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,Reclaiming Theology and Religious Traditions in the Tensions of Neoliberal Globalization: The Challenges of Pilgrimage and Migration,"Theologies on the move: religion, migration, and pilgrimage in the world of neoliberal capital"

In this book fifty leading theologians, scholars, and pastoral leaders offer their own assessment of the meaning of the Council, in many cases drawing on their personal experience as witnesses or participants. The contributors are a who s- who of modern Catholic voices: Francis Murphy (who, as Xavier Rynne, penned an inside account of the Council for The New Yorker, Lisa Sowle Cahill, John O Malley, Joan Chittister, Gregory Baum, Michael Novak, Basil Pennington, Richard McBrien, Cardinal Avery Dulles, John Dominic Crossan, Joseph Komonchak, Brother Roger of TaizÃ©, Cardinal Francis Arinze, Elizabeth Johnson, David Hollenbach, and many more. Beginning with an overview of the Council in context, successive chapters cover the liturgy; the understanding of the church; revelation, scripture, and tradition; ecumenism and interreligious dialogue; world issues and social justice. Many of the stories provide behind-the-scenes details of what went on at the Council as well as what went on in the lives of those it affected. For those who want to understand what happened at the Council, as well as those concerned about the state of the church today and the agenda for the future, these fifty personal stories provide an invaluable, and inspiring resource.",7/25/12,10/30/14 15:34,10/30/14 15:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,Orbis Books,"Maryknoll, NY",English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/Vatican-II-Fifty-Personal-Stories/dp/1570759936,,,"Madges, William; Daley, Michael J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,bookSection,Change as the Norm,Vatican II: Fifty Personal Stories

Written with an emphasis on clarity and concision, all entries are designed to help the reader understand and assess the specifically theological significance of the most important concepts. Clearly structured, the volume is organized around a small number of 'core entries' which focus on key topics to provide a general overview of major subject areas, while making use of related shorter entries to impart a more detailed knowledge of technical terms. The work as a whole provides an introduction to the defining topics in Christian thought and is an essential reference point for students and scholars""--",2011,2/10/15 16:53,6/17/20 16:38,,225-226,,,,,,,,,,,Cambridge University Press,New York,eng,,,,,Primo,BV2.5 .C36 2011,,,,,,Theology Dictionaries,"McFarland, Ian A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dictionaryEntry,Hope,The Cambridge dictionary of Christian theology

Both academic and non-academic philosophers are represented, as are a large number of female and minority thinkers whose work has been neglected. It includes those intellectuals involved in the development of psychology, pedagogy, sociology, anthropology, education, theology, political science, and several other fields, before these disciplines came to be considered distinct from philosophy in the late nineteenth century. Each entry contains a short biography of the writer, an exposition and analysis of his or her doctrines and ideas, a bibliography of writings, and suggestions for further reading. While all the major post-Civil War philosophers are present, the most valuable feature of this dictionary is its coverage of a huge range of less well-known writers, including hundreds of presently obscure thinkers. In many cases, The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers offers the first scholarly treatment of the life and work of these writers.",2005,6/27/18 20:10,9/21/20 18:03,6/27/18 20:10,,,,,,,,,,,,Thoemmes Continuum,,en_US,,,,,www.oxfordreference.com,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\AB43ARUP\acref-9780199754663.html,,,Philosophy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,dictionaryEntry,Frederick Herzog,The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers

Entries encompass individual religions and their variations, biographies, movements, issues, and the relationship of religion to the study of art, literature, and science.

Leading scholars provide extensive overviews of key topics, offering analyses of the trajectory and reception history of theological issues as well as critical assessment of Near Eastern and Greco-Roman antecedents for Old and New Testament perspectives. While many entries address the Bible's historical context, including traditional theological perspectives on creation, sin, covenant, grace, and forgiveness, others are more rooted in modern issues, featuring biblical perspectives on contemporary concerns such as wealth and poverty, gender/race discrimination, and market economics. The two-volume OEBT contains 168 entries ranging in length from 2,000 to 8,000 words. With bibliographic references and suggestions for further reading, each entry affords students and scholars a comprehensive topical and methodological summary of the topic that serves as both a go-to reference and a starting point for original research.

Using the Urban Poverty and Family Life Survey of Chicago and bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis techniques, this study examines the degree to which neighborhood poverty constraints, household economics, and demographic variables influence positive homeownership attitudes, homeownership behavior, and neighborhood ties. It documents the presence of attitudes and behavior associated with the middle class as well as social affiliations. The findings demonstrate the greater importance of household economic conditions over neighborhood effects. Results also show that some respondents have attitudes, behavior, and, to a lesser extent, neighborhood ties similar to those found in the larger society.

These manuscripts were catalogued in the nineteenth century shortly after a large collection of over 500 manuscripts were acquired by the British from the monastery of Dayr al-Suryān in Egypt. This article examines the intellectual assumptions that guided the nineteenth-century cataloguing efforts and offers a methodological proposal for how a new digital catalogue of the manuscripts could and should differ. New methods of digital representation can permit users to engage the Dayr al-Suryān manuscripts and the whole of the British Library Syriac collection from multiple, varied, and even conflicting perspectives. Several such digital approaches are being implemented in Syriaca.org’s digital catalogue of the British Library Syriac manuscripts. The diversity of such digital approaches promises to open new insights into the history of Christianity in late antiquity and beyond.",12/6/16,6/30/22 18:36,6/30/22 18:36,6/30/22 18:36,136-182,,1,5,,,Mixed Up by Time and Chance?,,,,,,,eng,,,,,brill-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu,,Publisher: Brill,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\WPG5M7LV\Michelson - 2016 - Mixed Up by Time and Chance Using Digital Methods.pdf,,,British Library; British Museum; Codicology; Digital Humanities; Diverse Knowledges; Graph Databases; History of Christianity; Linked Open Data; Manuscripts; Orientalism; Postcolonial Studies; Syriac; Syriaca.org; Traditional Cultural Expressions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,journalArticle,Mixed Up by Time and Chance?

A decade of scholarship has accrued since its advent in religious studies with little notice among pastoral care specialists. Although several pastoral theologians have written about children generally, it has been almost twenty years since a scholar in the discipline has written a book on pastoral care and counseling of children that takes into consideration the intervening research. I chart some of the developments and characteristic features in the social sciences and theological studies that need to be kept in mind and argue that distinct advances have occurred, worthy of greater engagement by the pastoral counseling community, in both the recognition of children as active agents in families and other social institutions and the understanding of religion as shaped as much by routine practices as by verbal confession of belief claims.",2014,4/5/16 21:09,4/5/16 21:12,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The e-Journal of the American Association of Pastoral Counselors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,journalArticle,Childhood Studies and Pastoral Counseling,Sacred Spaces

4FVRWKE7,"Lim, Paul",2008,"Coffey, J.; Lim, P.C.H.",,,10.1017/CCOL9780521860888.001,,"In 1564, or thereabouts, the English discovered a new term of abuse - 'Puritan'. Initially, it was an insult launched at nonconformist clergy within the newly reformed Elizabethan church, zealous Protestants who refused to wear prescribed liturgical vestments, particularly the white surplice, and who gained a reputation as 'opposers of the hierarchy and church-service'. But soon the nickname was taken up by 'profane mouths', who deployed it rather indiscriminately 'to abuse pious people'. 'Puritan' became a handy smear word for bishops angered by clerical nonconformity, metropolitan playwrights provoked by censorious moralism, and villagers driven to distraction by assaults on traditional festive culture. By the early seventeenth century, Patrick Collinson explains, 'Puritanism' had become 'the brand name for a certain kind of Protestant religiosity, social conduct and politics'. The polemical origins of the term have troubled historians, and led some to call for the abolition of Puritanism as a historical category. Yet for most scholars of early modern England and New England, the concept has proved indispensable. As the American historian Michael Winship explains, Puritanism is 'an extremely convenient shorthand term', but one that 'is unavoidably a contextual, imprecise term, not an objective one, a term to use carefully but not take too seriously in itself'. Defining Puritanism has become a favourite parlour game for early modern historians. Some readers will be familiar with the discussion, but others may appreciate some basic orientation. The chapters in this collection offer different perspectives and approaches to the problem of definition, and together they build up a multifaceted picture of our subject. But we can begin by locating Puritans on the map of sixteenth and seventeenth-century European Christianity. © Cambridge University Press 2008.",2008,11/22/22 20:52,11/22/22 20:52,,1-16,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,ISBN: 9781139001960,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\PA59CEKG\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,journalArticle,Introduction,The Cambridge Companion to: Puritanism

In doing so, this preaching too often disregards global conflicts and tragedies, painting them as the results of God's judgment for immorality. African American preachers are thus increasingly focused on private morals, letting the world-transforming public implications of faith take a back seat. Black religious communities have hence been uninvolved in trying to solve contemporary conflicts, which is especially distressing regarding the volatile situations in the Middle East. Therefore, African American churches need to reclaim, as Martin Luther King, Jr. has said, their prophetic roles and work to care for the entire world.",2008,5/22/14 17:53,6/30/20 15:32,,,,1,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Primo,,,,,,,Theology; Christianity; Race & Ethnicity; Reconciliation & Conflict Resolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,journalArticle,Global Conflict and the Preaching Tradition of Martin Luther King Jr.,The Review of Faith & International Affairs

[David Klinghoffer Doubleday], a conservative columnist for the Jewish weekly Forward, and one of the United States' more public Jews who have made the journey to Orthodoxy, has a lucid and witty style. He corrects many a misunderstanding about Judaism, refutes Christian arguments that both Jesus and support for his messianic role can be found in classical Jewish sources, and delineates the various reasons why Jews have not accepted Christian claims. He offers the correct, timely and trenchant observations that too many Jews have too little familiarity with their own texts, history or theology, that Jews are often embarrassed by the particularities of traditional beliefs and practices, and that the American Jewish ""secular leadership"" creates unnecessary fear by condemning the growing voice of Evangelical Christians. Klinghoffer does not fear offending his readers, and offense may well be the reaction to his portraits of Jesus and Paul. His Jesus is a foxy, highly conflicted healer, but healing does not, as Klinghoffer shows, a messiah make. Jesus fails to win the loyalty of the majority of Jews who encounter him - whether in his time or subsequently - because he fails to fulfill any major messianic expectations, such as ingathering the exiles or establishing eternal peace. His initial followers were easily duped Galileans famous for their lack of Torah-knowledge and easily taken in by this phenomenally charismatic teacher, who entertained extravagant notions about his own role in history. Finally, Jesus is an apikorus, a Jew who knowingly and willfully rejects the tradition of the Rabbis (the Oral Law). Any Jew who converts to Christianity, from [Paul] onward, is thus, Klinghoffer implies, not only an ignoramus taken in by dubious Biblical arguments, but also a dupe and a dope who knows nothing about Judaism. Whereas Klinghoffer's typical Christians are neurotic, for ""some part of the Christian soul would always be disturbed by the apprehension, however suppressed, that the Jews were right,"" the Jewish psyche is not afflicted by the complementary neurosis (it's nice to know we've escaped one): Jews do not worry that maybe Christians are right. We couldn't: After all, their teachings fail on both textual and philosophical grounds, and, moreover, the souls of Jews are programmed differently.",7/11/05,11/7/16 15:54,11/7/16 15:54,11/7/16 15:54,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,(Copyright (c) 2005.

Her numerous works, including ""Israeli Women: the Reality Behind the Myth"" (1978), ""Where Mountains Roar: A Personal Report from the Negev and Sinai Desert"" (1980), and ""Jerusalem Jerusalem,"" her 1986 memoir of her life in Israel in the 1970s and 80s, reveal her psychological expertise and an understanding for the complexities of her subjects. Plus, this British-born psychologist and journalist is a splendid writer. Surely, this ""Jew who once seriously considered becoming a rabbi,"" ""former convent schoolgirl who daydreamed about being a nun,"" and ""agnostic with a deep sense of religious mystery though no affinity for organized religion,"" as she describes herself in the book's introduction, would envision a [Mary] who would resonate with readers from diverse religious backgrounds; surely she would bring her knowledge of today's Middle East to bear on recreating life at the turn of the Christian Era, but, given her historical care, would do so without sliding into anachronism. In large measure, she succeeds. While Hazleton does not, and could not, present a definitive Maryam, as [Jesus]' mother is known in Aramaic, her informed portrait (the bibliography runs to 12 pages) not only avoids the historical nonsense that marks so many studies of Jesus, but is also intellectually as well as aesthetically compelling. It recollects the Great Virgin, the Magna Mater, Isis -- other mother goddesses who hold the power of fertility and whose paradoxical identifications as virgin and mother transcend the mundanely physical. The title ""virgin"" signifies power, not physical attribute. This biography does consider whether Maryam was raped, and one scenario has her raped by a priest and so serves to explain Jesus' enmity toward the Temple. Although Hazleton eventually concludes that Jesus' father is Mary's husband, Joseph, (whom she, in line with a growing trend in New Testament studies today, posits was from Bethlehem of the Galilee, not Judea), her passionate insistence that ""the idea of rape does no dishonor either to Maryam or to her son"" should be required reading for all victims of sexual abuse. As for the popular question -- made even more popular with the controversy surrounding the reputed ossuary of Jesus' brother [James] -- of whether Mary had other children, Hazleton does propose that the ""brothers and sisters"" mentioned in the Gospels are not Mary's children. Her reasons, however, have nothing to do with the theological claim that Mary remained a virgin pre partum, in partu and post partum, and everything to do with first-century life. Hazleton's major target is the Temple. In her reconstruction, Galileans saw the Judean temple as a corruption of Israelite values and faith. The ""real revolution of the Jesus movement"" was the replacement of the Temple with the individual, the exchange of a system promoting hierarchy and wealth by one that drew no distinction between man and woman, sinner or saint, rich or poor. A glance at the Gospels corrects such reductionism: Joseph and Mary visit the Temple for sacrifice and pilgrimage, as did other Galileans. The Temple welcomed both saint and sinner, as Jesus' parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector (Luke 18:9-14) demonstrates; it welcomed poor and rich, Jew and gentile. The leadership may have been corrupt, and [Herod]'s turning the Temple into a Hellenized tourist attraction an abomination, but even Galileans respected the institution, and Jesus' followers, including his mother, continued to worship there.",5/17/04,11/7/16 15:50,11/7/16 15:50,11/7/16 15:50,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,(Copyright (c) 2004.

AP9YJ53W,"Hudnut-Beumler, Jim",,"Hudnut-Beumler, James",,,,http://www.researchonreligion.org/christianity/james-hudnut-beumler-on-religion-in-the-now-south,"When you think if Christianity in the U.S. South, images of Southern Baptist congregations, conservative politics, and even snake-handling may come to mind.  But Prof. James Hudnut-Beumler, the Anne Potter Wilson Distinguished Professor of American Religious History at Vanderbilt University, reveals that the spiritual tapestry is much more nuanced than might appear on initial glance.  Prof. Hudnut-Beumler joins us to talk about his new book Strangers and Friends at the Welcome Table and reveals how several historical traditions have persisted in the region while significant transformations are also taking place. We commence with a discussion of a definition of “the South,” which can be viewed geographically (starting just below Northern Virginia, running down to the top portion of Florida, and extending westward to Arkansas and encompassing the southern portions of Indiana and Illinois) and spiritually (those areas with a majority Southern Baptist population).  Jim explains how this decade-long process took him on a “r0ad trip” around the region to experience the lives and institutions of those living in what he calls the “Now South,” a region with deep roots to its “Old Time Religion” past, but which is also changing in surprising ways.  Looking at the historical roots first, we discuss how religion, food, and hospitality are intimately linked via kinship networks and a concern over scarcity being a daily lived experience.  Food and visitation are viewed as an expression of love for folks who are ill, imprisoned, or otherwise facing difficult times.  Jim also notes that food and hospitality also becomes a basis for various types of social activism as such community involvement is often viewed as a measure of piety.  Sometimes such activism can take on hard-nosed policies towards drug addicts who are allowed assistance only if they quickly accept Jesus, or in more open terms that seek to get mentally ill individuals the help they need.  We also chat about how Pentecostalism, technically a very small fraction of Southern Christians, has influenced the Christianity of the region, often leading to “Bapticostal” congregations that call their ministers bishops and have multiple offerings.  Religion also manifests itself along racial lines in the South, as one might expect, and Jim talks about religiously-infused racial histories can wound but also offer up possibilities for forgiveness.  He raises the horrific shooting at the Charleston Emmanuel AME Church in 2015 as an example of these racial divides and how the power of forgiveness is used not necessarily to “forgive and forget,” but to heal tragedies so it doesn’t wound the victims continuously. The conversation then moves in the direction of the “Now South” and the new trends that have been reshaping the spiritual landscape over the past several decades.  We look at how megachurches are setting new standards of worship not only for congregants in the suburbs, but in smaller rural and urban churches as well.  Jim points out how the growth of homeschooling has responded to the integration of private religious schools (often called “segregation academies”).  The growth of Catholicism with the influx of immigrants from Mexico and Central America has also diversified the religious tapestry of the region.  And finally, we discuss the surprising increase in the number of congregations that have taken a welcoming position to the LGBT communities and how it has roiled the waters.  Jim explains that while it is easy to preach hate, the culture is changing via kinship ties and the “power of one” wherein one individual can help to change the views of those around them.  While still a very small minority of churches, the presence of LGBT-friendly congregations indicate progressive steps forward. We finish off by asking Prof. Hudnut-Beumler what he would tell a younger version of Jim if he had the chance to travel back in time.  The elder Jim provides some interesting words of advice for his younger self recognizing that things you never thought would have made an impression early on often come back to you as new opportunities for exploration and learning.

Weighing in at 715 pages, The Gospel of Luke by Amy-Jill Levine and Ben Witherington III is a part of the New Cambridge Bible Commentary series. It does all of the things a full commentary should, but it also contains a series of friendly arguments in written form between an evangelical Methodist scholar and an agnostic feminist Jewish scholar who attends an Orthodox synagogue but describes herself as “often quite unorthodox.” They disagree on Luke’s attitude towards Judaism, his view of women, and sometimes his meaning or sources. But there’s also a lot these two distinguished scholars agree on. In this wide-ranging discussion we focus on this book’s origin, their agreements and disagreements, mistaken anti-Jewish readings of Luke, their opposition to replacement theology readings of Luke or Paul, radical views about the gospels such as mythicism, ancient anti-Marcionism and Luke 1-2, Luke’s anti-docetism, and the genre, authorship, style, and dating of this famous gospel. They have produced a model of informed, respectful, and reasonable dialogue between Christians and Jews, and you can hear aspects of their long dialogue here in part 1 of our discussion.",,6/11/20 18:53,6/11/20 18:53,4/30/20 19:31,,,,,,,,,,,Trinities,,,en-US,,,,,,,Library Catalog: trinities.org,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\B9M83KCV\podcast-236-levine-and-witherington-on-luke-part-1.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,236,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,podcast,Levine and Witherington on Luke Part 1,
