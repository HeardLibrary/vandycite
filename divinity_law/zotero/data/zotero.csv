"Lim, Paul",2013,"Lim, P.C.H.",978-0-19-997909-7,,,,"This book offers an examination of the polemical debates about the doctrine of the Trinity in seventeenth-century England, showing that this philosophical and theological re-configuration significantly impacted the politics of religion in the early modern period. Through analysis of these heated polemics, the book shows how Trinitarian God-Talk became untenable in many ecclesiastical and philosophical circles, which led to the emergence of Unitarianism. It also demonstrates that those who continued to embrace Trinitarian doctrine articulated their piety and theological perspectives in an increasingly secularized culture of discourse. Drawing on both unexplored manuscripts and well-known treatises of Continental and English provenance, the book unearths the complex layers of the polemic: from biblical exegesis to reception history of patristic authorities, from popular religious radicalism during the Civil War to Puritan spirituality, from Continental Socinians to English Anti-Trinitarians who avowed their relative independent theological identity, from the notion of the Platonic captivity of primitive Christianity to that of Plato as ""Moses Atticus."" Among this book's surprising conclusions are the findings that Anti-Trinitarian sentiment arose from a Puritan ambience, in which Biblical literalism overcame rationalistic presuppositions, and that theology and philosophy were not as unconnected during this period as previously thought. © Oxford University Press, 2014.",2013,11/22/22 20:47,11/22/22 20:47,,,1,,,,,Mystery Unveiled,Mystery Unveiled: The Crisis of the Trinity in Early Modern England,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,Pages: 512 DOI: 10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195339468.001.0001,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\IWNHWB4J\display.html,,,Christianity; Trinity; Plato; Unitarianism; Anti-trinitarian sentiment; God-talk; Polemical debates; Politics of religion; Seventeenth-century england,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q106421012,ZXA42IH8,book,Mystery Unveiled: The Crisis of the Trinity in Early Modern England,

The redactional approach is adopted, and John 15:1-17 is designated as an originally independent discourse.  The exegetical analysis of the passage shows the presence of an interrelated christological-ethical problem (docetic christology/libertine behavior) within the Christian community and thus thrusts these verses directly into the Sitz im Leben of 1 John.  Thus, the passage is said to be a later addition to the Gospel coming from the stage of 1 John.",3/1/82,5/21/14 19:45,8/25/21 16:30,5/21/14 19:45,115-128,,1,101,,Journal of Biblical Literature,The theology and provenance of John 15,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\W6APFAVH\Segovia - 1982 - The theology and provenance of John 151-17.pdf,,,Peer reviewed; Bible.

However, the clearly concluding statements of 14:30-31c, the command of 14:31d to arise and depart, and the obvious connection of these verses with the beginning of the passion narrative (18:1-12) appear to divide this farewell into at least two seemingly independent and separate discourses.... In this present study, the author leaves all questions concerning chaps 15-17 aside and turns exclusively to the first discourse of 13:31-14:31.  Given its more limited scope, one would expect a greater degree of scholarly consensus concerning such issues as the structure, the Tendenz, and the Sitz im Leben of 13:31-14:31 than with chaps 15-17.  However, a review of the exegetical literature shows a great deal of disagreement with respect to these questions.   Such a situation is most unfortunate, because widespread agreement does exist with respect to the importance of this unit for and within the Fourth Gospel.

The aesthetic excellence consists not of balanced structure, predictable rhythmic patterns, or intricate design. Rather, it is on account of its brilliant imagerial contrast, its clever employment of both symmetry and asymmetry, its shrewd play with lineation, its subtle use of ambiguity and polyvalence, and its performative closure that this poem deserves to be considered among the finest in the Psalter and indeed the Bible. Furthermore, the essay shows how interpreters through the centuries are indispensable conversation partners for the modern interpreter. They broaden the horizon of every interpreter, and their voices contribute to a deeper appreciation of Psalm 1 as a theologically profound introduction to the Psalter, thereby inviting the reader to live a commendable life amid uncertainties, but a life that leads nevertheless to the praise of God.",2013,10/21/14 21:45,10/21/14 21:45,10/21/14 21:45,275-293,,2,132,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Project MUSE,,"<p>Volume 132,&nbsp;&nbsp;Number 2, 2013</p>",,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\H7MSUP24\132.2.seow.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q106976698,2NV86XAT,journalArticle,An Exquisitely Poetic Introduction to the Psalter,Journal of Biblical Literature

They demonstrate how theological ideas have ""legs,"" playing themselves out not only in religious communities but in the public square as well.

In response to the latter dynamic, levels of tithing, income, and mission donations are examined based on a national sample of 1,601 Black churches across seven denominations using linear and ordered logit modeling. Findings show minimal ideological and programmatic effects. However, denominational differences suggest that Black congregations affiliated with the Church of God in Christ have higher relative percentages of tithers and those associated with the Presbyterian and United Methodist faiths have the lowest rates as compared with their Baptist peers. Moreover, African Methodist Episcopal Zion, Presbyterian, and United Methodist churches are more likely to have higher church incomes and mission giving than Baptists. Thus, although Baptists tend to generally have higher rates of church tithers, this pattern does not translate to higher church incomes or mission donations. As expected, church size and formally educated memberships positively influence giving patterns.

It notes that the alternative logic or ethics of wealth that results from the traditions of Jesus reflected throughout the Gospels.,2013-11,6/26/18 18:16,8/11/21 20:53,6/26/18 18:16,153-162,,33,,,Buddhist-Christian Studies,The Ethics of Wealth in a World of Economic Inequality,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\BABGG573\Rieger - 2013 - The Ethics of Wealth in a World of Economic Inequa.pdf,,,CHRISTIANS; EQUALITY; ETHICS; FAITH (Christianity); WEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109407937,6JR72K7Z,journalArticle,The Ethics of Wealth in a World of Economic Inequality: A Christian Perspective in a Buddhist-Christian Dialogue,Buddhist-Christian Studies

As the connections between the flows of power and ideas are examined, a deeper understanding of Schleiermacher's theology emerges both in terms of its limitations and its potential.

In this article, reflections on labor, class, and justice help deepen ongoing interreligious dialogues between engaged Buddhism and liberation Christianity that began with the work of Paul Knitter and others. Although neither the topic of labor nor the topic of class is commonly studied in theology or religion, our investigation reveals deeper affinities with Christian and Buddhist traditions, broadening the conversation to include voices not often discussed in the West like that of B.R. Ambedkar, the prominent convert from Hinduism to Buddhism and father of the Indian constitution. Moreover, the topics of labor and class invite new engagements with the notion of justice, which is contested in the religious and cultural traditions of the West as well as in many Buddhist discourses, which tend to question its usefulness altogether. In the process of engaging not only the topics of labor and class as abstract categories but also related movements—in particular the labor movement and other global social movements—new possibilities for religious discourse and interreligious dialogue emerge that broaden contemporary understandings of religion. This leads to rethinking concepts such as reconciliation, nonviolence, solidarity, and social action in various contexts around the globe and in their usages in Christian and Buddhist traditions.",2019,8/18/21 18:04,8/18/21 18:04,8/18/21 18:04,133-146,,1,39,,,"Religion, Labor, Class, and Justice",,,,,,,,,,,,Project MUSE,,Publisher: University of Hawai'i Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109408068,RCW2HVCF,journalArticle,"Religion, Labor, Class, and Justice: Buddhist—Christian Dialogue in Fresh Perspective",Buddhist-Christian Studies

Happiness in one person can offend when another experiences the happiness as goodness of life that is being withheld from them. Since all persons carry the memory of happiness, seeing the happiness of others reminds us of something once owned or experienced, but now lost. Envy becomes a defense against the painful memory of happiness once known. The biblical figure King Saul is identified as someone who experienced envy in the face of a young David’s happiness.

The case of a 17-year-old boy and his excessive use of Internet pornography is used to highlight pornography’s impact on a person’s well-being and neurology. A brief exploration of three histories of masturbation shows how the discourse on masturbation often serves political agendas and addresses the central role of sexual fantasy in the practice. Sexual fantasy is explored through the research of British psychoanalyst Brett Kahr. To examine the significance of the eye in pornography, philosopher Michael Taussig’s concept of “the eye as the organ of tactility” is discussed.

In this essay, the author does not assess Trump personally but rather what he signifies with regard to financialization. He begins by documenting the phenomenal increase in household and total global debt that began during the onset of neoliberalization, as Trump was beginning his business enterprises. This debt has created a global economic and moral emergency. Second, the author discusses the central role of debt in financial capitalism and in the neoliberal ideology, or faith narrative, that justifies the debt system. Debt has become so foundational that it is transforming not only the economy but also culture, relationships, and subjectivity. This yields a new form of moral injury that is becoming pervasive. In the third move, he considers debt as a social, interpersonal, and psychological conundrum. Many mainline progressives are insistent that debt can be reformed and thus serve societies, communities, and individuals in beneficent ways. The author contends that the proposed reforms would likely spell the end of capitalism, an outcome these theorists generally wish to avoid. Furthermore, he points to evidence from psychoanalytic psychotherapy indicating that even relational, nonmonetized forms of indebtedness may prove to be interpersonally and psychologically damaging. Relational obligations, he notes, do not have to follow the logic of debt. Finally, the author contests Christian theological narratives that understand sin and salvation in terms of debt and debt forgiveness, and he points to an alternative approach within the history of Christian theology that holds promise given the current environment of toxic and insufferable debt.",10/1/19,6/11/20 19:01,6/11/20 19:01,5/12/20 19:30,511-532,,5,68,,Pastoral Psychol,“I’m the King of Debt”,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109408533,SHC9SV7A,journalArticle,“I’m the King of Debt”: Pastoral Reflections on Debt in the Age of Trump,Pastoral Psychology

The author’s own playing, in the form of long-distance motorcycling provides a backdrop of lived experience for the essay.

The former stance positions the Black Church for involvement in electoral and protest politics; the latter stymies these processes. This project examines the contemporary Black Church's political presence on several social media sites. Findings document its continued political involvement thematically associated with calls for social justice and moral action, electoral and protest politics, redress for social problems, and a linked fate mentality and collective memory. Moreover, results illustrate how electoral and protest politics, based on a historic Black Church cultural toolkit, can reflect both a social issue to be championed and a strategic process used to promote other agendas. A resistance versus accommodation dialectical model provides a cogent explanation for the political pluralism and ambiguity such congregations can exhibit as well as for many Black Christians to prioritize issues of racial justice and economic empowerment above more conservative religious views they may espouse.",2014,7/18/14 18:57,6/16/21 19:20,7/18/14 18:57,209-235,,2,18,,J Afr Am St,Black Church Electoral and Protest Politics from 2002 to 2012,,,,,,,en,,,,,link.springer.com,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\VWXVKZJX\Barnes and Nwosu - 2014 - Black Church Electoral and Protest Politics from 2.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\IKF6RR9T\10.html,,,"Social media; Politics; Sociology, general; black church; Political Science, general; Regional and Cultural Studies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109408540,5QX72EUI,journalArticle,Black Church Electoral and Protest Politics from 2002 to 2012: a Social Media Analysis of the Resistance Versus Accommodation Dialectic,Journal of African American Studies

Yet Black students continue to lag behind their White counterparts in academic outcomes. This research note examines; (1) sponsorship of tutoring or literacy programs based on a national sample of 1,863 Black churches across seven denominations and (2) the forms of congregational cultural capital that influence such efforts. Results show denominational differences. Moreover, larger churches as well as those with formally educated leaders and members are more likely to sponsor tutorial or literacy programs. Churches that provide religious and religious-education programs, include gospel rap music during worship, and strive to increase members’ awareness of racial, social, and political issues are also more likely to sponsor these programs. Lastly, although the influence of spiritual dictates varies, churches that more frequently expose members to sermons about personal spiritual growth are also more apt to offer these youth educational programs. Best practices are provided to identify and harness the various forms of church capital found in Black congregations to improve educational outcomes for Black students.",2015,7/24/14 22:28,6/16/21 19:45,7/24/14 22:28,111-129,,1,57,,Rev Relig Res,"To Educate, Equip, and Empower",,,,,,,en,,,,,link.springer.com,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\D7V47QC6\10.html,,,"Education; Religious Studies; Sociology, general; black church; Anthropology; Literacy programs; Psychology, general; Tutoring; Youth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109408541,4QHEUD3F,journalArticle,"To Educate, Equip, and Empower: Black Church Sponsorship of Tutoring or Literary Programs",Review of Religious Research

Drawing on Berry’s (1976, 2005, 2009) concept of acculturation that emphasizes integration and multiculturalism rather than assimilation, this ethnography examines the educational practices at Shaw Academy, a charter school for immigrant, refugee, and native-born children. We focus on the school’s involvement in positive ethnic identity development for refugee students, strategies to combat injustices, and self-efficacy promotion. Findings suggest that multicultural teaching, curricula, and programmes, spearheaded by ethnically diverse personnel, promote academic adjustment for refugee students by fostering appreciation for cultural diversity, positive ethnic identity development, and agency. Moreover, students learn to manage conflict and cultivate the intellectual and emotional tools needed to become change agents in society. Our findings provide important implications and best practices for schools interested in proactively meeting the educational needs of refugee students.",2014,7/24/14 21:45,6/16/21 19:49,7/24/14 21:45,434-456,,3,27,,Journal of Refugee Studies,Where ‘Difference is the Norm’,,,,,,,en,,,,,jrs.oxfordjournals.org,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\EWMUC5EA\Nwosu and Barnes - 2014 - Where ‘Difference is the Norm’ Exploring Refugee .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\XNFHF464\jrs.fet050.html,,,Cultural diversity; acculturation; ethnic identity; refugee education,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109417521,QPSU7X6K,journalArticle,"Where ‘Difference is the Norm’: Exploring Refugee Student Ethnic Identity Development, Acculturation, and Agency at Shaw Academy",Journal of Refugee Studies

This article focuses on how Long's masterwork has stimulated innovative theories and methods utilised in analysing the origins and varieties of black religious experience in the wake of New World slavery that often have been subsumed under the heavy-laden concept of “Black religion.” Additionally, this article contextualises the influential nature of Long's work upon the history of black religions in the modern world as modalities of both orientation and meaning-making by emphasising the book's powerful descriptions and critical analyses of black religious phenomenology.

A mother's imprisonment potentially exposes children to a concentrated disadvantage that undermines their cognitive, emotional, and intellectual abilities. Additionally, such experiences can have deleterious effects on mother-child relationships, stand-in caregivers, foster care caseloads, the penal system, and society. Less may be understood, however, about how imprisonment affects the ways in which women view themselves as mothers. This study examines mothering attitudes for a sample of 210 Black, White, and Hispanic imprisoned mothers. Nested modeling results suggest a positive relationship between favorable views about mothering and children's profiles and mothers' expectations about future custody.

Introduction” and its role in his development of historical materialist criticism in the wake of Derrida’s attempted revaluation of the identification of religion with ideology in Marx’s later writings. It first focuses upon Marx’s appropriation and use of Feuerbach’s criticism of religion in “Contribution” and the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts. Then it situates “Contribution” ’s famous apothegm, religion “is the opium of the people,” in relation to Marx’s subsequent writings on the “Celestial Empire” China and in the context of opium’s multiple contemporary significations. Marx’s understandings of religion and its critique are thus seen to well exceed the assumed limitation of the latter’s purview to ideology criticism and the conventional characterizations of the former as false consciousness, ineffectual protest, and/or depoliticizing consolation. Marx’s criticism-of-religion is shown to exemplify what he calls “irreligious criticism.”",2/5/14,6/27/14 19:41,7/22/20 20:59,6/27/14 19:41,3-21,,1,26,,,Table Dancing in an Opium Den,,,,,,,,,,,,booksandjournals.brillonline.com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\59DQ2C59\Geller - 2014 - Table Dancing in an Opium Den Marx’s Conjuration .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\49U723KB\15700682-12341263.html,,,China; criticism-of-religion; Jacques-Derrida; Karl-Marx; Ludwig-Feuerbach; opium-of-the-people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109417560,M5DAIX66,journalArticle,Table Dancing in an Opium Den: Marx’s Conjuration of Criticism out of “Criticism of Religion” in 1844,Method and Theory in the Study of Religion

Black women's radical subjectivity shatters the boundaries of geopolitical spaces traditionally defined through citizenship while creating alternative social imaginaries that represent a space where home and belongingness may be attained and self-determination realized. It is from the examination of Black women's textualities that one can detect an upheaval of nation-state racial formations that subverts the policing power of the state to force and essentialize racial identities. In this article, the authors trace the process of subverting forced identities, violent acts, and the narrativity of race. The authors analyze the lives, the movements, and the actions of the Black female protagonists from three geopolitical contexts as portrayed in the following novels: African American author Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple,"" Caribbean author Michelle Cliff's ""No Telephone to Heaven,"" and South African author Lauretta Ngcobo's ""And They Didn't Die"".",5/1/02,5/13/14 19:46,6/30/21 15:50,5/13/14 19:46,528-556,,5,32,,Journal of Black Studies,"Subverting Forced Identities, Violent Acts, and the Narrativity of Race",,,,,,,,"Copyright © 2002 Sage Publications, Inc.",,,,JSTOR,,,,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\UV2PJAIS\Floyd-Thomas and Gillman - 2002 - Subverting Forced Identities, Violent Acts, and th.pdf",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109417604,IXP8E27U,journalArticle,"Subverting Forced Identities, Violent Acts, and the Narrativity of Race: A Diasporic Analysis of Black Women's Radical Subjectivity in Three Novel Acts",Journal of Black Studies

Yet, literature supports the historic centrality of the Black Church for the former group and the indelible influence of Catholicism for the latter. This research examines common religious themes and organized efforts associated with these faith traditions for the two historically oppressed groups. Informed by Cultural Theory, this study compares and contrasts religious cultural dynamics to illumine adaptive features and activism. Exilic themes based on nationality, race, and/or ethnicity tied to biblical symbolism; social programs and self-help; as well as appropriation of Liberation Theology are common group patterns. Yet, findings also illustrate the inability of religion to foster substantial intergroup cooperation in light of other prevailing systemic forces.",2014,1/5/15 22:28,6/16/21 19:33,1/5/15 22:28,294-320,,3,39,,Humanity & Society,,,,,,,,en,,,,,has.sagepub.com,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\98EHC58N\0160597614560567.html,,,Religion; African American; immigrant; Irish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109417659,ID2WJWKT,journalArticle,Exiles in a Foreign Land A Comparative Analysis of the Historical Role of Religion for African Americans and Irish Immigrants,Humanity & Society

When facing the dearth of extra-biblical evidence which directly and incontrovertibly authenticates the historicity of the biblical traditions, modern historiographers search their own pasts for models that give coherence and plausibility to the reconstruction they undertake.

Her intellectual and political interests and commitments include the racial and transnational dimension of feminist theory and politics; the intersections of race, class, gender, and post-colonial studies within the African diaspora and transnational Latina contexts; and feminist and anti-racist education and pedagogy within the U.S. academy. Stacey M. Floyd-Thomas Stacey M. Floyd-Thomas is a Social/Christian/Womanist ethicist and scholar. She is an assistant professor of Religious Studies, Women's Studies, and Black Studies in the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Virginia. In her scholarly research she examines the effects that the normative institutions of church, education, family, and nation-state formation have on defining marginalized groups and such institutions' undertaken tasks to subvert normative standards in order to define their own identities. Notes 1. Anzaldúa (1987) uses the term new mestiza consciousness to distinguish her model from the Chicano nationalist mestizo identity. She uses this term to confront the tradition of male dominance within her community. The new mestiza consciousness, which we also refer to as mestizaje, has as its primary purpose to validate Chicana selfhood. Her goals in this endeavor are twofold: (1) to break down the dualities that subordinate Chicanas in order to abandon contradictory notions of selfhood and embrace one's differences in a newly realized whole self. Her articulation of Chicana lesbian theory, for example, breaks down the dichotomy between male and female attributes through a reoriented conceptualization of sexuality and (2) to claim the indígena part of Chicana identity as an appeal to resist essentialized notions of identity in order to critique her culture's denial of the indigenous part of Chicana culture and history. Anzaldúa thus redefines Chicano cultural nationalism through gender and sexuality, paving the way for the consciousness of a fully racialized feminist Chicana. Chéla Sandoval draws on Anzaldúa's theoretical model of mestiza consciousness in order to create a method for Chicana empowerment. 2. For more on the relationship between women of color's literary tradition and its relation to history, see Katie Cannon (1988). 3. When we say re-member, we mean one thing: to reunite what has been separated when the border crossed over Mexico to form a New Mexico/Nuevo Mexico, by culturally acknowledging that unity through a way of being, a consciousness that the Chicana, the new mestiza, brings to this process. This re-membering fits squarely within recent trends among Chicano scholars who have begun to develop notions of ""trans-creation,"" a term to describe the process of a new cultural formation among Mexican and American Latino cultures. This process is deemed innovative and creative, developed from a history of living in cultural ambiguity. As cultural historian George J. Sanchez (1993) observes, Mexicans continue this custom in the United States as they live in the cultural-in-between, or borderlands. This is not a social imaginary but rather a reality of these people wherein the intent is to give this conscienticized process legitimacy as a geopolitical and cultural process. 4. Various theorists, as noted by Sandoval, have provided alternative terms for the differential mode, namely womanist, mestiza, third force, and hybrid. 5. In ""The Countryless Woman"" (1995), Castillo underscores their shared colonization, their shared entry into the transnational labor force into which Mexic-Amerindian women are born, and which was created out of Mexico's neo-colonialist relationship to the United States. Mexicans and MexicanAmericans alike have served a labor force controlled by U.S. policy. Mexico encourages the emigration of this labor force to alleviate its own depressed economy and the United States consumes this labor force without giving back to it the benefits enjoyed by U.S. residents. 6. For further elaboration of mujerista theology, see Isasi-Diaz's En la lucha/In the Struggle. 7. The maternal is a central theme in this novel. Although we do not have the time or space to develop the topic here, the reworking of the myth of Guadalupe as the mythic reincarnation of the ""good"" mother is one of the most intriguing aspects...",2001,5/13/14 19:57,6/30/21 15:42,5/13/14 19:57,158-175,,1,2,,,Con un pie a cada lado/With a Foot in Each Place,,,,,,,,,,,,Project MUSE,,"<p>Volume 2, Number 1, 2001</p>",,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\K6IRRJ2A\Gillman and Floyd-Thomas - 2001 - Con un pie a cada ladoWith a Foot in Each Place .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\529M8HPN\2.1.gillman.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109417673,RIGN2GWJ,journalArticle,Con un pie a cada lado/With a Foot in Each Place: Mestizaje as Transnational Feminisms in Ana Castillo's So Far from God,"Meridians: feminism, race, transnationalism"

It indicates that the doctrine, though at present still to be completed, is the recapitulation of the entire scheme of redemption. The central structuring concept in that scheme is that of the genuine union between the divine existence of the infinite creator and human nature in Christ, a pattern replicated in the coming of the Holy Spirit as the inauguration of a second, strictly analogous union of God and humanity. The subtle way in which Schleiermacher conceives these unions in line with his rigorous understanding of radical causality of divine creation requires careful unpacking. Only such an analysis brings to light the architecture of the doctrine of the Trinity, and its function as a kind of meta-doctrine, connecting and coordinating different elements in the doctrine of grace. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die kurze Koda in Schleiermachers Der christliche Glaube , die die Trinität behandelt, beabsichtigt nicht, die Lehre zu marginalisieren. Sie deutet eher an, dass die Lehre, obwohl gegenwärtig noch nicht vervollkommnet, die Rekapitulation des ganzen Erlösungsschemas ist. Der strukturierende Zentralbegriff dieses Schemas ist die genuine Einigung des unendlichen Seins des Schöpfers mit der menschlichen Natur in Christus. Die Ankunft des Heiligen Geistes wiederholt dieses Muster, insofern sie die Einführung einer zweiten, wenn auch analogen Einigung von Gottheit und Menschheit ist. Eine sorgfältige Analyse ist notwendig, um den raffinierten Zusammenhang zwischen diesem Einigungsbegriff und Schleiermachers striktem Verständnis der radikalen Kausalität der göttlichen Schöpfung zu beschreiben. Nur eine solche Analyse erklärt den Aufbau der Trinitätslehre und ihre Funktion als Metalehre, die die verschiedenen Bestandteile der Gnadenlehre Schleiermachers verknüpft und koordiniert.",7/1/10,2/1/22 21:45,2/1/22 21:45,2/1/22 21:45,17-39,,1,52,,,Ter mundus accipit infinitum,,,,,,,en,,,,,www-degruyter-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu,,Publisher: De Gruyter Section: Neue Zeitschrift für Systematische Theologie und Religionsphilosophie,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\LS24YUQZ\DeHart - 2010 - Ter mundus accipit infinitum The Dogmatic Coordin.pdf,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109417963,HINLQLC6,journalArticle,Ter mundus accipit infinitum: The Dogmatic Coordinates of Schleiermacher's Trinitarian Treatise,

This study argues that two different literary strata may be observed and separated in the narrative: 13:1a, 4-5, 6-11 constitute the original version in the Gospel and present the washing as a sēmeion of Jesus' glorification; vv. 1b-3, 12-20 represent a later insertion from the time of 1 John and present the washing as an example of humble behavior which is to be imitated.",1982,5/21/14 19:46,8/25/21 15:58,,31-51,,1,73,,Zeitschrift für die neutestamentliche Wissenschaft und die Kunde der älteren Kirche,"""John 13",,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rfh&AN=ATLA0000794730&site=ehost-live&scope=cite,,"Bible.

Each of these errors and slips is occasioned by what he terms a ‘mésalliance’ between a Jew and a Gentile. Such incidents of distorted language betray unresolved ambivalences and unformulated anxieties endemic to Jewish-Gentile interaction in Freud's Vienna. First, the disturbed relationships between German-speaking Gentiles and their threatening Doppelgänger, the Jews, are analyzed by means of Freud's analysis of the ‘uncanny’ and an examination of the particular restrictions placed upon the ‘offi cially’ emancipated Jews in the Habsburg Empire, especially with regard to intermarriage. Then, the paper turns to Freud's discussions of explicitly Jewish-identifi ed individuals and their limitation to illustrating parapraxes associated with what should be the most pleasurable and intimate relationships between Jew and Gentile, namely sexual and connubial relations. His focus upon this confl icted conjunction diagnosed the intrinsically problematic character of Jew-Gentile interaction in his Vienna.",10/1/04,6/30/14 19:13,6/30/14 19:13,6/30/14 19:13,1209-1223,,5,85,,,The psychopathology of everyday Vienna,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\66272MDB\abstract.html,,,Ethnicity; Sigmund Freud; (the) uncanny; Antisemitism; doppelgänger (doubles; fin-de-si–cle vienna; identity (construction; jewish–gentile interaction; mésalliances (intermarriage); parapraxes; psychopathology of everyday life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109417965,J2WFMFQ9,journalArticle,The psychopathology of everyday Vienna: Psychoanalysis and Freud's familiars,The International Journal of Psychoanalysis

This claim is a direct result of the #BlackLivesMatter movement’s sui generis origin and evolution beyond any identifiable Black religious institution. Robin D. G. Kelley reminds us that “insisting that we are human and productive members of [American] society has been a first principle of Black abolitionist politics since at least the eighteenth century.” Thus it is important to recognize the contemporary significance of #BlackLivesMatter by placing it within a broader historical context that resonates with many tenets of the traditional Black freedom struggle yet also charts future directions, including nontheistic thought and praxis such as atheism, agnosticism, humanism, and other expressions of unbelief as part of the broader African American experience. In 2009, Pew Research Center data on religious pluralism in the United States revealed that more than 12 percent of African Americans nationwide readily self-identified as being unaffiliated with any particular religion. This group of Black nonbelievers constitutes the third largest cohort within African American religious life—a major development in the history of African American faith and culture that ought to be more fully explored and explained. Scholars have discussed the origins and varied nature of Black humanism at considerable length; this article builds upon that existing research by examining the origins and nature of Black humanism within the history of the Black freedom struggle.",5/19/17,2/13/18 22:26,2/13/18 22:26,2/13/18 22:26,,,1,4,,,“A Relatively New Discovery in the Modern West”,,,,,,,en,Copyright (c) 2017 Kalfou,,,,tupjournals.temple.edu,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\444N4W2P\Floyd-Thomas - 2017 - “A Relatively New Discovery in the Modern West” #.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\6CTGF6G8\140.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109417966,URMYW99P,journalArticle,“A Relatively New Discovery in the Modern West”: #BlackLivesMatter and the Evolution of Black Humanism,Kalfou

It begins its interrogation of the appeal of the centaur to several Jewish writers after the era of human-equine symbiosis ended by tracing how distinctions between horse and donkey as well as judgments of horsemanship had previously mediated gentile/Jewish difference. Then, while noting the possible influences of earlier Jewish literary constructions of Judentum- associated horses or horse-human hybrids on Levi, Malamud, and Scliar, the essay turns to their particular works. Mounted upon their respective human-horse hybrids, these three writers explore the supplemental character of Jewish identification in Western modernity, by which the dominant gentile society's ascribed Jewishness supplemented and often superseded the thus-identified individual's own diverse identifications. These writers examined this Jewish condition in relation to the modern Western (male) individual's experiences of doubleness, as well as to whether there was a place for any hybrid subject that may emerge out of—and be distinct from—the identifications by which Jews were interpellated into or out of the ""human"" community.",2019-01,6/11/20 18:50,6/11/20 18:50,5/14/20 20:55,215-242,,2,37,,Prooftexts,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,Publisher: Indiana University Press,,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\5R5N5CRN\Geller - 2019 - A Horse is a Horse, Of Course, Of Course, or Som.pdf",,,HORSEMANSHIP; HUMAN-animal relationships; INTERPERSONAL relations; JEWISH authors; MODERNITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109418033,TRJJ2WEH,journalArticle,"""A Horse is a Horse, Of Course, Of Course,"" or Some Nagging Suspicions about Some Jewish Writers",Prooftexts

This feuilleton by W appeared in the Wiener medizinischer Presse on 14 July 1895 -just over a week before Freud's ‘Dream of Irma's Injection’. Connecting these events is a third item: a note entitled ‘Eine Quelle des Antisemitismus’ apparently written by Freud during the 1890s. The note refers to an ‘Irma’ who was raised in Hungary. Freud's only known patient who fits this criterion is Ilona Weiss, Elisabeth von R. in Studien. This article pursues the floating signifiers ‘Irma’ and ‘Weiss’ through a series of correlations and reconstructions of identities. First, combining the near coincidence of dream and review with her identification as Elisabeth von R. suggests that Ilona Weiss is part of the Sammelperson that is ‘Irma’. In addition, textual evidence leads to the conclusion that the essay's author is Heinrich Weiss, a Jewish neurologist and a respondent to Freud's ‘Ub...",2/1/00,7/1/14 18:36,7/1/14 18:36,7/1/14 18:36,61-75,,1,2,,Psychoanalysis & History,Some More Additional ‘Day Residues',,,,,,,,,,,,Edinburgh University Press Journals,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\K4SQA5D6\pah.2000.2.1.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109418038,DBBR2IGU,journalArticle,"Some More Additional ‘Day Residues': The First Review of Studien Uber Hysterie, Ilona Weiss and the Dream of Irma's Injection",Psychoanalysis and History

The ritual of circumcision was itself moreover interpreted as a cause of syphilitic contamination. The effects of syphilis and of sexuality between the races were thus progressively linked.

Informed by black liberation and womanist theologies, this mixedmethodological study across 16 black megachurches assesses clergy views on the subject as well as whether their congregations are welcoming and affirming, open, or exclusionary regarding black women in church roles. Results show that most black clergy in the study are open to black women's participation and leadership; black women hold a myriad of positions in both churches and in church-sponsored secular organizations. When constraints are placed on womanism, it is to encourage male leadership in familial and pastoral roles. In such scenarios, pastors tend to emphasize gender role complementarity rather than equality. However, pastors who most adamantly espouse black liberation and womanist tenets are most likely to be welcoming and affirming of black women's full participation without caveats to their involvement. Moreover, such churches tend to promote inclusivity of other historically oppressed groups such as sexual minorities and to encourage open discourses about controversial issues among adults and youth in general.",2015,7/7/20 19:19,7/7/20 19:19,7/7/20 19:19,115-143,,2,3,,,,,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,JSTOR,,Publisher: University of Illinois Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q109418047,T4F43C2A,journalArticle,Black Megachurches and Gender Inclusivity,"Women, Gender, and Families of Color"

Stated differently, therapists become therapists to heal themselves. Drawing on object relations theory, the author identifies five ""wounds"" therapists may consciously and unconsciously address by entering a therapeutic profession. The wounds are located in the capacity to believe, the capacity to imagine, the capacity for concern, the capacity to be alone, and the capacity of object usage. Achieving these capacities provides the therapist with a sense of wholeness, health, and holiness.",2001,6/13/14 14:20,7/7/21 19:08,,,,3,40,,,The search to be real,,,,,,,English,,,,,Primo,,,,,,,Christopher Bollas; Object Relations Theory; Psychotherapists; Vocation/Calling; DW Winnicott; winnicott,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q110550678,D7Z5GWM5,journalArticle,The search to be real: Why psychotherapists become therapists,Journal of Religion and Health

Dollar, a prominent televangelist and renowned mega church pastor, posted an online video soliciting charitable donations (“love gift of any amount”) from his followers and other potential donors in order to buy a Gulfstream G650 airplane worth an estimated $65 million. According to the video presentation on Creflo Dollar Ministries website (which was quietly removed from the website a few days later), the ministry currently owns a private jet that was built in 1984 and acquired by Rev. Dollar in 1999. On the video, a ministry spokesperson reported that the plane traveled at least 4 million miles but was no longer safe. On a recent trip overseas, the ministry’s website states, one of the engines failed while the plane was in midair. Despite the great peril, the pilot was able to land safely and none of the passengers aboard was injured. As a result of this mishap, Dollar and his team made this statement: [W]e are asking members, partners, and supporters of this ministry to assist us in acquiring a Gulfstream G650 airplane so that Pastors Creflo and Taffi [Dollar] and World Changers Church International can continue to blanket the globe with the Gospel of grace … We are believing for 200,000 people to give contributions of 300 US dollars or more to turn this dream into a reality. © The Editor(s) 2016.",2016,11/22/22 18:04,11/22/22 18:04,,303-318,,,,,,Economic justice and globalization in black church studies,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,DOI: 10.1057/9781137534552,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\Y2G7NYA5\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q110910492,ENGHWE28,bookSection,Economic justice and globalization in black church studies: Confronting the “Malignant Kingship” in the post-civil rights era,The Black Church Studies Reader

Paul DeHart examines the special mode of divine transcendence (God's infinity) and investigates areas where accepting an infinite God presents challenging questions to Christian theology. He discusses what would 'saving knowledge' or 'faith' have to look like when confronted by such an unlimited conceptions of deity, and ponders on how can the doctrine of God's trinity be brought into harmony with radical notions of transcendence; as well as whether the doctrine of creation itself is threatened when the conception of creator's mind is not maintained. DeHart engages with a quite diverse range of figures: Jean-Luc Marion, Schleiermacher, Kierkegaard, Kathryn Tanner, John Milbank and Rowan Williams, to illustrate his conviction. This volume deals with deep conceptual issues, indicating that creation ex nihilo remains a lively topic in contemporary theology""--",2021,6/23/21 20:32,6/23/21 20:32,6/23/21 20:32,,,,,,,Creation and transcendence,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1226072805,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q110920769,M9ESAL74,book,Creation and transcendence: theological essays on the divine sublime,

Following the scriptural witness of God as the Earthroamer, the book explores the liminal qualities of traveling through six movements: anticipating, leaving, surrendering, meeting, caring, and returning. To travel is to move at the speed of being present to one's experiences, bridging distance and difference through acts of care. Drawing on personal experience as well as the wisdom of theology, anthropology, psychology, philosophy, and cultural studies, Hamman reimagines travel in a welcoming and beautiful yet also complex and troubled world. Whether leaving home serves our wanderlust and curiosity or has personal or spiritual purposes or whether we travel a few miles or cover vast distances, we travel best when we contribute to human flourishing. Care - the compassionate reaching out to someone or something - is the practice that allows one to travel differently. The spirituality of roads is filled with hopeful restorative potential, and life is best lived with the Earthroamer.""--Jacket",2021,6/29/22 18:28,6/29/22 18:28,,,,,,,,Just traveling,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1250202837,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q110920771,TS87ZKW2,book,"Just traveling: God, leaving home, and a spirituality for the road",

Baxter (1615-1691) lived through the British Civil Wars, the Regicide, the Interregnum, the restoration of monarchy and episcopacy in 1660, subsequent ejection of numerous Puritan pastors, and the Glorious Revolution of 1689. His eccesiology was formed within these multifarious contexts. Among others, three significant facets of purity, unity, and liberty are examined in detail. This book re-examines the central role of catechizing and congregational discipline in Baxter's understanding of the true church, his insistence that the purity and unity of the church are to be pursued concurrently, the self-perceived identity of English Puritans, and the quesiton of the true church in the latter-half of the seventheenth century.""--Jacket.",2004,5/1/14 20:59,6/17/20 18:03,,,1,,,,,,,,,,Brill,Leiden ; Boston,eng,,,,,Primo,BX9323,,,,,,"Church; Author of The last century, 1615-1691; Bacster, Richard, 1615-1691; Bacter, Richard, 1615-1691; Bakster, Richard, 1615-1691; Baxter, Mr. (Richard), 1615-1691; Baxter, R.

As a distinctive and particularly intense variety of early modern Reformed Protestantism, it was a product of acute tensions within the post-Reformation Church of England. But it was never monolithic or purely oppositional, and its impact reverberated far beyond seventeenth-century England and New England. This Companion broadens our understanding of Puritanism, showing how students and scholars might engage with it from new angles and uncover the surprising diversity that fermented beneath its surface. The book explores issues of gender, literature, politics and popular culture in addition to addressing the Puritans’ core concerns such as theology and devotional praxis, and coverage extends to Irish, Welsh, Scottish and European versions of Puritanism as well as to English and American practice. It challenges readers to re-evaluate this crucial tradition within its wider social, cultural, political and religious contexts. © Cambridge University Press 2008.",2008,11/22/22 20:50,11/22/22 20:50,,,1,,,,,The Cambridge companion to,The Cambridge Companion to: Puritanism,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,Pages: 385 DOI: 10.1017/CCOL9780521860888,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\QXJBAPNW\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q110920775,GUUW64QU,book,The Cambridge companion to: Puritanism,

But, one life time is not enough to master the fine art of living. Distilled over centuries, the biblical book of Ecclesiastes offers us the time-tested advice of Israel's sages. This is the best of wisdom, with echoes of East and West-from Zen and Tao to Merton and Moore--all rolled into one. In Ecclesiastes, Bible scholar Choon-Leong Seow creatively translates and carefully interprets one of the world's most profound, most enduring collections of ancient wisdom. Sometimes joyful and exultant, other times cynical and fatalistic, the ancient author Qohelet (""Teacher"") wrestles with the ups and downs of real life. Even today, we recognize and repeat the sayings of this treasure-trove of apt advice. The book begins and ends with the infamous claim, ""Vanity of vanities, says Qohelet, vanity of vanities! All is vanity!"" In between, the sage leaves no stone unturned in the search for meaning.

"Thompson, Lisa L.",2021,"THOMPSON, LISA L.",978-1-5064-5386-6,,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvp7d5c9,"Preachers often feel stuck when met with quickly shifting and dense media topics that flood the headlines. If and when they determine it is appropriate to address issues that arise in the news cycle, they are often at a loss for how to speak about them from the pulpit. When preachers understand that a responsibility to sustain life is embedded in the purposes of preaching, they discover greater fluidity between the everyday world, the biblical text, and preaching itself.  <i>Preaching the Headlines</i>  reframes preaching as an ongoing conversation between the modern world and the world of the Bible, exploring where the divides between the two may be less rigid than we often acknowledge. The preacher uses what they know about life as a bridge to the text, while life in the text provides the bridge back to faith in the contemporary world. The goal of the book is to help preachers do theological reflection on the everyday world as an integral part of sermon development. The process offered in this book is not a substitute for basic methods of sermon development nor a model of exegesis for preaching. Preachers will use this process as a supplement alongside their current method of sermon preparation. Before the preacher can ever translate the meaning embedded in the headlines, they have to learn more about the topics they seek to preach about. They do this by digging behind the headlines and expanding their own resources beyond theological traditions alone. This work is done in order to think earnestly about how faith might spur transformative action in our world for more just ways of living together.",2021,6/28/22 19:22,6/28/22 19:25,6/28/22 19:22,,,,6,,,Preaching the Headlines,Working Preacher,,,,1517 Media,,,,,,,JSTOR,,DOI: 10.2307/j.ctvp7d5c9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q110920786,L25P8GPZ,book,Preaching the Headlines: Possibilities and Pitfalls,

Religion in the Age of Obama explores the religious and moral underpinning of the Obama presidency and of subsequent debates regarding his tenure in the White House. It provides an analysis of Obama's beliefs and their relationship to his vision of public life, as well as the way in which the general ethos of religion and non-religion has shifted over the past decade in the United States under his presidency. Including chapters from John L. Jackson Jr., Kathryn Lofton, Sylvester A. Johnson, Keri Day, and Max Perry Mueller, topics include how Obama has employed religious rhetoric in response to both international and domestic events, his attempt to inhabit a kind of Blackness that comforts and reassures rather than challenges White America, the limits of Christian hospitality within U.S. immigration policy, and the racialization of Islam in the U.S. national imagination. Drawing on a wide-range of topics, this book shows that the years of the Obama presidency served as a watershed moment of significant reorganization of the role of religion in national public life.

How and why does such senseless suffering occur? What is the relationship between loss and hope? What are the benefits of examining loss and hope from an interreligious focus? These are some of the questions addressed in this volume, written by leading international scholars and which also includes contributions by those who have suffered: survivors of genocide and state terror. Case studies of loss and hope from around the world are discussed, including from the United States, Ireland, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Iraq, Argentina, China, and Chile. Religions examined include Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism.  Three interconnected lenses are used to explore new perspectives on loss and hope: survivors and victims' testimony; interfaith studies; and ethical approaches. The book highlights the need for responses to atrocity that transcend differences within gender, class, religion, race and ethnicity. The authors stress the need for partnership and dialogue from an interfaith perspective, and while neither hiding not unduly minimizing the extent of losses in the world, attempt to establish an ethics of hope in the face of destabilizing losses in the realms of human rights and post-conflict resolution.  Loss and Hope is the first book to bring together this high level and diversity of scholars living and working all over the world from different faith, cultural and ethnic backgrounds examining the universal themes of loss and hope.",7/7/14,6/26/18 17:19,6/26/18 17:23,6/26/18 17:19,,,,,,,,,,,,Bloomsbury Academic Publishing,,en,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\LNI7TAW4\loss-and-hope-9781472525413.html,,,,"Admirand, Peter",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q111089516,2M2P4TR5,bookSection,Losing Confidence in Free-Market Economics and Free-Market Religion: Recovering True Hope,"Loss and Hope: Global, Interreligious and Interdisciplinary Perspectives"

Almost always the first step is an attempt to find their roots in an ancient lineage.”1 Whether we agree with E. Franklin Frazier’s argument that such a feat is hopeless for African Americans, due to our cultural amnesia caused by the ravages of the transatlantic slave trade, or whether we adopt Melville Herskovitz’s claim that we African Americans have, in fact, retained our African roots, even if only aesthetically, it is undeniable that the most knowable history of African Americans is rooted in the history and wisdom of the hush harbors and invisible institutions of that which has preserved and promoted the faith of Black people.2. © The Editor(s) 2016.",2016,11/22/22 18:24,11/22/22 18:24,,59-67,,,,,,A field of study as a field of dreams,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,DOI: 10.1057/9781137534552,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\7F4VQQTF\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q111731371,FK3XZ7U2,bookSection,A field of study as a field of dreams: The contours of black church studies,The Black Church Studies Reader

Individual essays model useful approaches for pursuing these dimensions of religious organizations without neglecting their religious dimensions. Some of the essays are also models for critical inquiry into the sometimes self-serving compromises religious individuals and groups make with market capitalism in contemporary American life. The essay considers why previous theologically inclined scholars have neglected the kind of inquiry represented by the volume and celebrates the Business Turn as a ""Big Idea"" in the historiography of American religion worthy of emulation by other scholars interested in pursuing the nature of the American religious enterprise. By following flows of funds and bodies, watching who is raising money for what philanthropy, and how religious businessman and philanthropists justify themselves, the volume's authors upset common assumptions about American religion. © Oxford University Press 2017.",2017,11/22/22 20:01,11/22/22 20:01,,199-222,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,DOI: 10.1093/oso/9780190280192.003.0010,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\QUYT9TJJ\display.html,,,American church history; CEOs and capitalism; Evangelical history; Market thinking,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q111731374,WVX2W2J4,bookSection,Afterword,The Business Turn in American Religious History

Each chapter is written by a leading scholar and includes: the biographical and historical context of each theorist -- · their approaches and key writings -- analysis and evaluation of each theory -- suggested further reading. Part One: Comparative Approaches considers how major features such as taboo, texts, myths and ritual work across religious traditions by exploring the work of Mary Douglas, Phyllis Trible, Wendy Doniger and Catherine Bell. Part Two: Examining Particularities analyzes the comparative approach through the work of Alice Walker, Charles Long and Caroline Walker Bynum, who all suggest that the specifics of race, body, place and time must be considered. Part Three: Expanding Boundaries examines Gloria Anzaldúa's language of religion, as well as the work of Judith Butler on performative, queer theories of religion, and concludes with Saba Mahmood, whose work considers postcolonial religious encounters, secularism, and the relationship between ""East"" and ""West.""

The contributions explore how interpreters of scriptural texts regularly assume or assert an identification between their own communities and those described in the text, while ignoring the cultural, social, and religious differences between themselves and the text's earliest audiences. Comparing a range of examples, these essays address varying ways in which social identity has shaped the historical contexts, implied audiences, rhetorical shaping, redactional development, literary appropriation, and reception history of particular texts over time. Together, they open up new avenues for studying the relations between social identity, scriptural interpretation, and religious authority.""--",2020,8/31/21 15:39,8/31/21 16:03,,169-195,,,,,,,Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament studies,,,,London: Bloomsbury T&T Clark,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1201529271,,,,,,"Brown, Ken; Joseph, Alison L; Breed, Brennan W",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q111731400,XV7ETZ5F,bookSection,Perspectives on a Pluriform Classic,Reading other peoples' texts: social identity and the reception of authoritative traditions

"Michelson, David A.",2016,David A. Michelson,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvpj7dsk,"Evagrius of Pontus (ca. 345-399) was a Greek-speaking monastic thinker and Christian theologian whose works formed the basis for much later reflection on monastic practice and thought in the Christian Near East, in Byzantium, and in the Latin West. His innovative collections of short chapters meant for meditation, scriptural commentaries in the form of scholia, extended discourses, and letters were widely translated and copied. Condemned posthumously by two ecumenical councils as a heretic along with Origen and Didymus of Alexandria, he was revered among Christians to the east of the Byzantine Empire, in Syria and Armenia, while only some of his writings endured in the Latin and Greek churches. A student of the famed bishop-theologians Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil of Caesarea, Evagrius left the service of the urban church and settled in an Egyptian monastic compound. His teachers were veteran monks schooled in the tradition of Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Anthony, and he enriched their legacy with the experience of the desert and with insight drawn from the entire Greek philosophical tradition, from Plato and Aristotle through Iamblichus. <i>Evagrius and His Legacy</i>  brings together essays by eminent scholars who explore selected aspects of Evagrius's life and times and address his far-flung and controversial but long-lasting influence on Latin, Byzantine, and Syriac cultures in antiquity and the Middle Ages. Touching on points relevant to theology, philosophy, history, patristics, literary studies, and manuscript studies, <i>Evagrius and His Legacy</i>  is also intended to catalyze further study of Evagrius within as large a context as possible.",2016,7/27/21 21:51,7/27/21 21:55,7/27/21 21:51,175-205,,,,,,,,,,,University of Notre Dame Press,,,,,,,JSTOR,,DOI: 10.2307/j.ctvpj7dsk.12,,,,,,,"KALVESMAKI, JOEL; YOUNG, ROBIN DARLING",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q111731402,3YMEH99R,bookSection,Philoxenos of Mabbug and the Simplicity of Evagrian Gnosis Competing Uses of Evagrius in the Early Sixth Century,Evagrius and His Legacy

"Segovia, Fernando F.",2009,"Segovia, F.F.",978-0-511-62711-8,,,,"Postcolonial biblical criticism enters the theoretical and methodological repertoire of the discipline in the latter half of the 1990s. Among critical approaches, therefore, it is of late vintage, marking the turn of the century – emerging, as it does, at the very end of the twentieth century and establishing a solid foothold only with the beginning of the twenty-first century. At first, it does so largely among critics fromthe non-Western world living and working in diaspora in the West and thus fitting the category of non-Western racial–ethnic minorities within the West. Such critics come to biblical criticism after the fateful developments in the discipline of the 1970s, which involved not only fundamental changes in method and theory but also incipient transformations in visage and voice. Soon, however, postcolonial criticism would become a major area of interest for non-Western critics outside the West, similar newcomers to the discipline, as well as for Western critics. The present exposition of this still-developing critical approach proceeds in two steps. The first part offers an overview of the approach as a whole in terms of historical path, theoretical foundations, and methodological configuration. The second part examines its particular application to the Gospel of Matthew, beginning with an overview of postcolonial interpretations of the Gospel in general and concluding with postcolonial readings of Matthew 8:5–13 in particular, the episode traditionally known as “The Healing of a Centurion's Servant.” © Cambridge University Press 2009 and 2010.",2009,11/28/22 19:38,11/28/22 19:38,,194-237,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,DOI: 10.1017/CBO9780511627118.009,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\H9K6Z2TL\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q111731407,3ESBLLVH,bookSection,Postcolonial criticism and the Gospel of Matthew,Methods for Matthew

The oftenanguished question of how to ""live together"" moved Derrida throughout his oeuvre, animating his sustained reflections on hospitality, friendship, responsibility, justice, forgiveness, and mourning, as well as his interventions as an outspoken critic of South Africa's apartheid, the Israel/Palestine conflict, the bloody civil war in his native Algeria, human rights abuses, French immigration laws, the death penalty, and the ""war on terror."" ""Live together,"" Derrida wrote, ""one must . . . one cannot not 'live together,' even if one does not know how or with whom."" In this volume, the paradoxes, impossibilities, and singular chances that haunt the necessity of ""living together"" are evoked in Derrida's essay ""Avowing--The Impossible: 'Returns,' Repentance, and Reconciliation,"" around which the collection is gathered. Written by scholars in literary criticism, philosophy, legal studies, religious studies, Middle Eastern studies, and sociology working in North America, Europe, and the Middle East, the essays in this volume tackle issues such as the responsibilities and fragility of democracy; the pitfalls of decreed reconciliation; the re-legitimization of torture in the ""war on terror""; the connections between Orientalism, Semitism, and anti-Semitism; the delocalizing dynamics of globalization; crimes against humanity; nationalism; and politics as the art not of the possible but of the impossible. The volume includes analyses of current controversies and struggles. Here, Derrida is here read in and with regard to areas of intense political conflict--in particular, those that oppose Israelis and Palestinians, Hindus and Muslims, victims and perpetrators of South African apartheid, Turks and Armenians.The necessity of an infinitely patient reflection goes hand in hand with the obligation of justice as that which must not wait. It is in the spirit of such urgency, of a responsibility that cannot be postponed, that the essays in this volume engage with Derrida's thinking on ""living together.""",2013,11/22/22 15:30,11/22/22 15:32,11/22/22 15:30,123-136,,,,,,,,,,,Fordham University Press,,English,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,"Weber, Elisabeth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q111731414,ERPSTH5X,bookSection,"Responsi/ability, after Derrida",Living Together: Jacques Derrida's Communities of Violence and Peace

The translocation of where Americans worshipped transformed the way they worshipped. As pervasive as suburbs later became in American life, their emergence at the end of the nineteenth century owed to a confluence of factors that made these new communities a unique development in Western history. The word “suburban” literally denotes being “below the city,” as in outside the citys walls and its protection. In traditional European civilization the suburbs were a residential location for the poor with inferior services. As a result of rapid late nineteenth-century improvements in communication and transportation, suburbs in the United States emerged as desirable residential enclaves connected to, but set apart from, more crowded and dirty cities. Since then suburbs in American life have been alternately viewed as refuges for the wealthy, signs of what is wrong with the culture at large, and, increasingly, simply the way Americans live. Suburbanization in the American context has been a social movement of both desire and necessity with far-reaching, often misunderstood ramifications for religion. The history of religion in suburbs is one of small beginnings in which suburban churches were, from the viewpoint of their denominations and sister churches in the cities, insignificant, and synagogues were virtually nonexistent. What began almost as an afterthought on the American religious landscape came to be one of religion's areas of greatest strength by the middle decades of the twentieth century. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",2009,11/22/22 20:03,11/22/22 20:03,,106-125,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,DOI: 10.1017/CHOL9780521871082.006,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\52B8VDHW\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q111731416,CE7DESB6,bookSection,Suburbanization and religion,The Cambridge History of Religions in America: Volume III 1945 to the Present

"Sasson, Jack",2003,"Sasson, Jack M.; Heller, Richard M.; Heller, Toni W.",,0031-5982,,,"The noun tsara'at appears about two dozen times in the Hebrew Bible, almost exclusively in Leviticus, where it is used to describe a state of ritual defilement manifested as a scaly condition of the skin, a condition of cloth, leather, and the walls of houses. In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, negac tsara'at was translated as aphe lepras; in the Latin Vulgate, this became plega leprae. These words in Greek and Latin implied a condition that spread over the body, not a term of ritual impurity. Tsara'at has continued to be translated as ""leprosy,"" even though this term is not appropriate, as there was no leprosy as we know it in the Middle East during the time period the Hebrew Bible was written. Others have suggested that the proper translation of tsara'at is ""mold.""

Fewer studies examine other problematic issues germane to gay and lesbian involvement in Black congregations. In this analysis, Black clergy dialogue during focus groups about inclusivity and church leadership by gays and lesbians. Informed by Cultural Theory, of equal interest is whether discourses are influenced by Black Church cultural tools, as well as cultural dynamics, from the broader Black community. As anticipated, findings suggest the tendency for clergy to promote welcoming church spaces, but to be reticent about affirming homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. Furthermore, although clergy are generally supportive of involvement by closeted gays and lesbians as lay leaders, most do not support their involvement in the clergy, particularly as pastors. However, views vary based on denomination and gender, and are informed by Black Church cultural components such as scripture and the call-and-response tradition.",2013,7/18/14 18:55,7/18/14 18:55,7/18/14 18:55,1409-1433,,10,60,,,To Welcome or Affirm,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,PMID: 24059966,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\BIBI9PKN\00918369.2013.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q43695207,STV3X2UI,journalArticle,"To Welcome or Affirm: Black Clergy Views About Homosexuality, Inclusivity, and Church Leadership",Journal of Homosexuality

Although the specific characteristics of these frameworks are context-dependent, the underlying themes remain the same: Jewish identification entails identifying “difference,” and this process of drawing distinctions between Jews and non-Jews gets developed in discursive frameworks of temporality, “race thinking,” nationalism, and genetics, among others. In the broader contexts within which Jewish identification is formulated, these frameworks serve to: (i) delineate categories of people on the basis of socially salient qualities associated with human and other bodies; (ii) evaluate these categorical “types” in regard to their determined “desirable” and “undesirable” qualities; (iii) implement institutionally sanctioned measures that facilitate the privileging of the people who apparently embody desired qualities; and (iv) enforce structural constraints within which people may choose to contest, re-inscribe, re-appropriate, and/or attempt to transform components of the other three networks mentioned above. It also emphasizes the significance of who mobilizes these discourses, with what objectives in mind, and how both factors instantiate discursive and discursively informed concretized outcomes.",8/1/14,9/16/15 15:35,6/30/21 18:24,9/16/15 15:35,165-194,,2,2,,Critical Research on Religion,Jewish identification and critical theory,,,,,,,en,,,,,crr.sagepub.com,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\PBQAJTN9\Glauz-Todrank et al. - 2014 - Jewish identification and critical theory The pol.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\BGDFR4J7\165.html,,,Race; Jewish identity; critical theory; discourse; identification,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q57634506,MIT3XGX6,journalArticle,Jewish identification and critical theory: The political significance of conceptual categories,Critical Research on Religion

In sum, the commentary seeks to allow Ruth, Naomi, and Boaz to speak again for the first time. © 2017 by Order of Saint Benedict, Collegeville, Minnesota.",2017,11/22/22 20:19,11/22/22 20:19,,,1,,8,,,Wisdom commentary,Wisdom Commentary: Ruth,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,Pages: 200,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Z5P3E5VS,book,Wisdom commentary: Ruth,

Responding to Darrell Bock, it notes that evangelicals are new to embrace the methods associated with such study but questions whether this shift advances discussion. Responding to Craig Keener, it questions both the value of using biographies of Roman offi cials to determine the reliability of Gospel portraits and the use of data derived from late rabbinic sources to determine Second Temple practices. Responding to Robert Webb, it suggests that his 'methodological-naturalistic' view regarding causation of events will be most productive in conservative settings where there is no preliminary argument as to whether the events in question actually happened.",2011,11/22/22 20:24,11/22/22 20:24,,96-106,,1,9,,,Christian faith and the study of the historical Jesus,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\E9SJAY84\display.html,,,History; Ancient biography; Evangelicals; Historical Jesus; Memory; Oral tradition; Rabbinic sources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q61000826,8RSQYYSU,journalArticle,"Christian faith and the study of the historical Jesus: A response to bock, Keener, and Webb",Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus

The question is, which disciplines are attracted and what do these disciplines have to contribute to the debate? In order to answer this question, the encyclopedia maps the (self)-identified disciplines and religious traditions that participate or might come to participate in the Science and Religion debate. This is done by letting each representative of a discipline and tradition answer specific chosen questions. They also need to identify the discipline in relation to the Science and Religion debate. Understandably representatives of several disciplines and traditions answered in the negative to this question. Nevertheless, they can still be important for the debate; indeed, scholars and scientists who work in the field of Science and Theology (Religion) may need knowledge beyond their own specific discipline. Therefore the encyclopedia also includes what are called general entries. Such entries may explain specific theories, methods, and topics. The general aim is to provide a starting point for new lines of inquiry. It is an invitation for fresh perspectives on the possibilities for engagement between and across sciences (again which includes the social and human sciences) and religions and theology. This encyclopedia is a comprehensive reference work for scholars interested in the topic of ‘Science and Religion.’ It covers the widest spectrum possible of academic disciplines and religious traditions worldwide, with the intent of laying bare similarities and differences that naturally emerge within and across disciplines and religions today. The A–Z format throughout affords easy and user-friendly access to relevant information. Additionally, a systematic question-answer format across all Sciences and Religions entries affords efficient identification of specific points of agreement, conflict, and disinterest across and between sciences and religions. The extensive cross-referencing between key words, phrases, and technical language used in the entries facilitates easy searches. We trust that all of the entries have something of value for any interested reader. Anne L.C.

While the experiences of imprisoned women may differ substantially from free mothers, studies suggest that motherhood is important for many imprisoned mothers. The current study uses a sample of 210 imprisoned mothers and multivariate modeling to investigate how familial relationships before and during imprisonment and mothers’ postrelease expectations influence the salience of maternal identity. Findings suggest that regardless of demographic factors, close mother–caregiver relationships, contact with family during imprisonment, and expecting to have custody of children upon release positively impacts imprisoned women’s mothering identities.",2014,7/18/14 18:53,1/5/15 22:31,7/18/14 18:53,3-23,,1,9,,Feminist Criminology,Is Motherhood Important?,,,,,,,en,,,,,fcx.sagepub.com,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\DFEM9TFC\29.html; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\72D596CT\3.html,,,Women; Identity; Mothers; Criminology And Law Enforcement; family; prison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q63443869,HEHREDTU,journalArticle,Is Motherhood Important?

"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",2014,"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",,312789,10.1007/s11089-013-0576-y,,"In this essay, I explore the political significance of depression, particularly as a prominent form of resistance to conditions of life under contemporary global capitalism. After noting the political context of the second beatitude, which suggests a form of mourning that bears witness to public suffering, I assert that under the current dominance of the disease model, depression has lost its political voice. This loss is of grave concern given evidence that the culture of late capitalism (neoliberalism) has initiated a global epidemic of depression. I reframe depression as the final cry of souls diminished under these conditions. Finally, I denote the qualities of such souls, illustrating with a pastoral psychotherapy case summary. A dream presented during the termination phase not only provides a clinical presentation of the attributes of souls under neoliberal governance, but suggests how voice may ultimately be restored even when depression has become unconscious.",2014-08,12/10/14 23:04,12/10/14 23:04,,503-522,,4,63,,Pastoral Psychology,Blessed Are Those Who Mourn,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rlh&AN=96774212&site=ehost-live&scope=cite,,CAPITALISM; DOMINANCE (Psychology); MENTAL depression; MOURNING customs; NEOLIBERALISM; POLITICAL psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q93432588,9PAHFJII,journalArticle,Blessed Are Those Who Mourn: Depression as Political Resistance,Pastoral Psychology

Christianity enforces this model of sexual dimorphism with the notion that to be a human being means to be created clearly “female” or clearly “male” in the image of God. This paper draws on interviews with German intersex Christians to explore their diverse images of God and what it means to be created in God’s image with the goal of creating new “conditions of possibility” that represent the full range of human sex/gender.,5/4/18,6/11/20 18:43,6/11/20 18:43,4/1/20 21:24,85-97,,2,24,,,“God is the creator of all life and the energy of this world”,,,,,,,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13558358.2018.1463643,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\RUF9J8BR\13558358.2018.html,,,images of God; Intersex; multiplicity; obscene Christs; sexual polymorphism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q94449528,MKRSMJ5T,journalArticle,“God is the creator of all life and the energy of this world”: German intersex Christians’ reflection on the image of God and being created in God’s image,Theology & Sexuality

This dynamic is particularly problematic given religious entanglements with free-market capitalism and the specific political economic vulnerability and religious diversity of recent immigrants and refugees. Interfaith organizing models, especially with their inclusion of labor unions, offer an important balance in the ecology of interfaith engagement and resistance to the civil religion of neoliberalism. Through these place-based, consociational collaborations, labor organizations help faith communities historicize, conceptualize, and navigate complex economic dynamics while expanding labor's value-frameworks, forms of organizing, and apprehension of worker's faith-filled identities.",2017,8/31/21 17:56,8/31/21 17:56,8/31/21 17:56,255-277,,2,45,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Wiley Online Library,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/jore.12176,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\FUGEG6HY\jore.html,,,capitalism; class; immigrants; inequality; interfaith; labor; organizing; refugees,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q95000146,IVA38JHS,journalArticle,Elaborating Faith,Journal of Religious Ethics

"Byrd, James P",2013,"Byrd, James P.",978-0-19-984349-7,,,,"""On January 17, 1776, one week after Thomas Paine published his incendiary pamphlet Common Sense, Connecticut minister Samuel Sherwood preached an equally patriotic sermon. ""God Almighty, with all the powers of heaven, are on our side,"" Sherwood said, voicing a sacred justification for war that Americans would invoke repeatedly throughout the struggle for independence. In Sacred Scripture, Sacred War, James Byrd offers the first comprehensive analysis of how American revolutionaries defended their patriotic convictions through scripture. Byrd shows that the Bible was a key text of the American Revolution. Indeed, many colonists saw the Bible as primarily a book about war. They viewed God as not merely sanctioning violence but actively participating in combat, playing a decisive role on the battlefield. When war came, preachers and patriots alike turned to scripture not only for solace but for exhortations to fight. Such scripture helped amateur soldiers overcome their natural aversion to killing, conferred on those who died for the Revolution the halo of martyrdom, and gave Americans a sense of the divine providence of their cause. Many histories of the Revolution have noted the connection between religion and war, but Sacred Scripture, Sacred War is the first to provide a detailed analysis of specific biblical texts and how they were used, especially in making the patriotic case for war. Combing through more than 500 wartime sources, which include more than 17,000 biblical citations, Byrd shows precisely how the Bible shaped American war, and how war in turn shaped Americans' view of the Bible.""--Publisher description.",2013,5/1/14 21:49,5/1/14 21:49,,,243,,,,,"Sacred scripture, sacred war",,,,,Oxford University Press,New York,eng,,,,,Primo,BS680 .W2 B97 2013,,,,,,"Bible Teachings; Bible Theology; Biblical teachings; Teachings of the Bible; Theology, Biblical; United States Church history 18th century; United States History Revolution, 1775-1783 Religious aspects Christianity; War Biblical teaching; War Religious aspects Christianity",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q96154435,CXNWASTQ,book,"Sacred scripture, sacred war : the Bible and the American Revolution",

Edwards himself was fully aware of the rivalry between Catholic France and Protestant England, and he saw the battles waged between these two powers on American soil as part of a larger cosmic struggle. What is sometimes forgotten, however, is that Edwards brought meaning to this setting by probing Scripture for what it had to say about war. Edwards preached a number of sermons on war during his lifetime, and from Scripture he found support for just wars and for the duty of citizens to serve in battle. By exploring Edwards' engagement with both the Old and New Testaments on war in his context, Byrd offers another angle on how Scripture shaped Edwards' life and thought, just as the issues of his day affected his reading of Scripture. © Oxford University Press 2018.

Though the great moral philosophers of the Enlightenment claimed all people could be perfectly moral through their own efforts, for Edwards only the truly converted could be truly virtuous. Morality was closely related to spirituality. Only those with transformed affections could truly love as God loves. This intimate relationship between conversion and ethics then remained a persistent yet controversial theme in American theology. Historians recognize that successors of Edwards developed his ideas for benevolence in various directions, often agreeing but often departing from the ""letter"" of his ethical law to apply its ""spirit"" to urgent ethical issues. This chapter examines the connection between conversion and ethics in New England theology after Edwards, focusing specifically on case studies of slavery, war, and the biblical themes through which ministers envisioned these moral crises in relation to religious experience. © Oxford University Press 2012.

Drawing upon an interdisciplinary body of research, Bruce Rogers-Vaughn describes an emerging form of human distresswhat he calls third order sufferingthat is rapidly becoming normative. Moreover, this new paradigm of affliction is increasingly entangled with already-existing genres of misery, such as sexism, racism, and class struggle, mutating their appearances and mystifying their intersections. Along the way, Rogers-Vaughn presents stimulating reflections on how widespread views regarding secularization and postmodernity may divert attention from contemporary capitalism as the material origin of these developments. Finally, he explores his own clinical practice, which yields clues for addressing the double unconsciousness of third order suffering and outlining a vision for caring for souls in these troubling times. .",2016,6/6/18 16:26,6/6/18 16:26,,,,,,,,,New approaches to religion and power; Variation: New approaches to religion and power.,,,,Palgrave Macmillan,"New York, NY",English,,,,,OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch,,OCLC: 965474427,,,,,Pastoral theology.

In doing so, this preaching too often disregards global conflicts and tragedies, painting them as the results of God's judgment for immorality. African American preachers are thus increasingly focused on private morals, letting the world-transforming public implications of faith take a back seat. Black religious communities have hence been uninvolved in trying to solve contemporary conflicts, which is especially distressing regarding the volatile situations in the Middle East. Therefore, African American churches need to reclaim, as Martin Luther King, Jr. has said, their prophetic roles and work to care for the entire world.",2008,5/22/14 17:53,6/30/20 15:32,,,,1,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Primo,,,,,,,Theology; Christianity; Race & Ethnicity; Reconciliation & Conflict Resolution,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZZAICG72,journalArticle,Global Conflict and the Preaching Tradition of Martin Luther King Jr.,The Review of Faith & International Affairs

"Armour, Ellen T.",2013,"Armour, Ellen T.",,1538-1617,,http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/36868-feminism-sexuality-and-the-return-of-religion/,"In 1997, John Caputo launched a series of conferences on religion and postmodernism, first at Villanova University then at his first post-retirement institutional home, Syracuse University. Feminism, Sexuality, and the Return of the Religious is the latest of the volumes of these conference proceedings published by Indiana University Press. Co-edited by Caputo and the distinguished feminist philosopher Linda Martín Alcoff, this volume follows its predecessors in bringing together a number of distinguished scholars from a variety of disciplines to reflect on a topic salient to both the academy and the wider culture. While the preceding volumes have typically included at least one feminist perspective on the issue at hand, this is the first to focus on feminism (and on sexuality). The predominance of scholars in religious studies in the volume also distinguishes it from its predecessors. They bring to bear their expertise in a number of subfields in religious studies including anthropology (Saba Mahmood), historical/theological studies (Mark Jordan), and feminist and womanist theology (Sarah Coakley, Kelly Brown Douglas, Catherine Keller). Deeply conversant in the philosophical and theoretical literature that constitute the intellectual backdrop of this series of conferences, these scholars engage with feminist and queer theory, critical race theory, literary studies, process thought, as well as contemporary continental philosophy, as appropriate. 	This particular convergence of scholarly expertise and framing question makes the volume a signal contribution to the burgeoning (if rather provincial, to my mind) discourse on the so-called return of religion. In his remarks that open the roundtable discussion at the volume's end, Caputo identifies two markers of religion's return: the recently ascendant political power of conservative Christianity in the U.S. and the newfound interest in religion -- primarily Christianity -- among literary scholars and philosophers, particularly in Europe. ""If modernization has meant secularization, the word postmodern, if it means anything, inevitably means 'post-secular,"" he says (160). As we'll see, the volume poses important challenges to this framework; indeed, to the concept of a return per se. 	A signal contribution of these conferences has been the importation of prominent European philosophers and theorists with interests in religion as keynote speakers. Fulfilling this role here are the Italian philosopher, Gianni Vattimo, and the French literary and cultural theorist Hélène Cixous. Vattimo argues in fairly brief compass that the Vatican's single-minded endorsement of marital reproductive heterosexuality grounded in ""nature"" pits the Church against modern science. Religion's return figures here as a nefarious recapitulation of the Church's stubborn and dogmatic rejection of Galileo and Copernicus; a return quite at odds with the forms of faith that Vattimo argues are possible after modernity's demise. 	Where Vattimo's contribution is more suggestive than substantial, Cixous' essay, ""Promised Belief,"" is both. She takes up the question of belief, but in a performative rather than discursive vein and in the intellectually rich and deeply personal context of her long friendship with Jacques Derrida, who died in 2004. Within the complex texture of their relationship, belief figured as something she supposedly had that he did not, but that he wanted -- or at least wanted her to have, for his sake as much as her own. But belief in what, you might ask? That is never made clear -- or at least, not to this reader -- and deliberately so, I think. The absence of a definite object signals the essay's particular contribution, as I see it, to the question of religion's return (which sometimes figures as belief's epistemological legitimization). While belief certainly appears here in the company of other religious themes, it does not operate as their epistemological ground. Indeed what matters about belief -- here, at least -- is not its object or the validity of its truth claims, but the effects of its circulation between, around, and beyond Derrida and Cixous. What would the discourse of religion's return look like if it took into itself this portrait of belief and its import? 	The contributions by scholars of religion to Feminism, Sexuality, and the Return of the Religious go yet more deeply into the overlapping terrain the title marks out. Jordan and Brown Douglas, for example, consider critical dimensions of Christianity's troubles with sexuality. Jordan, a preeminent scholar in queer Christian studies, offers a cogent, incisive and critical analysis of religion's purported return considered through the lens of current Christian speech about sexuality -- especially queer sexuality. That we find such strident condemnations of queer sexuality coupled with bellicose affirmations of marital heterosexuality coming out of the mouths of Christian spokespersons reflects Christianity's capitulation to the secular gods of modern (commodified, contained, controlled) sexuality, Jordan argues. This calls into question Christianity's return in (at least) two ways. First, insofar as the modern secular discourse of sex is the scion of its medieval Christian predecessor (for all their differences, beneath the figure of the modern homosexual lies the medieval sodomite, as Jordan has shown elsewhere), the line between the secular and the religious presupposed by ""return"" erodes. Second, this capitulation belies the full complexity of Christian speech --- and silence -- around sex. As Jordan has shown elsewhere, Christianity long preferred celibacy over and even in marriage, for example. It also (unintentionally) enabled and ultimately sought to constrain what we have come to call ""mysticism,"" arguably a form of Christian eroticism. Such occlusions simultaneously close off and evoke hopes for a ""return"" of a queerer Christian sort. 	Similarly, Brown Douglas reads the question of religion's purported return through the attempt by African American churches and communities to combat associations of blackness with sexual abnormality through enforcing ""hyper-proper sexuality"" (110). On the one hand, Brown Douglas diagnoses this as an unfortunate capitulation to the modern sexual regime, which figured black men and women as hypersexual and thus objects of fear, fascination, and particularly exploitation. Embedded in this capitulation is a recapitulation of what she calls ""Platonized Christianity;"" that is, a form of Christianity that severs body from soul, the sexual from the sacred. Present from Christianity's inception, Platonized Christianity found a comfortable home, she argues, in the white protestant evangelical traditions formative of black church traditions and, through that institution, the views of the black community. She draws on Ann Petry's novel, The Street, in part to illuminate the price exacted from black women, in particular, by this (re)capitulation. But The Street also opens onto an important countercurrent in black cultural life, the blues. Though often castigated by black Christianity as the devil's music because of its sexually explicit lyrics and sensual musicality, these very features, Brown Douglas argues, render the blues a vehicle for the sacred, particularly for a religious tradition that is founded in the claim that God became flesh. 	Like Jordan and Brown Douglas, feminist theologians Keller and Coakley continue to pursue issues of longstanding interest to them and to their readers. Keller considers the prospect of religion's return under the rubric of ""returning God."" To what extent and how is feminist theology positioned in contemporary God-talk; a discourse bounded on one end by its engagement with the death of God theologies of the 1980's (Thomas J.J. Altizer, etc.) and by the global resurgence of mostly patriarchal forms of religion? As an alternative to the specter of a (resurrected) ""good old God"" -- whether God the Father or ""Yahweh in a skirt"" (Nelle Morton) -- Keller draws on strands in continental thought, in queer and feminist theology and theory, and in Christian mystical traditions to imagine a return of an altogether otherwise God; a God figured as manifold, with multiple becomings, in-carnations. 	Coakley's essay is a provocative meditation on the gendered dynamics of sacrifice, subjection and submission in Christianity -- here considered through the akedah (the near-sacrifice of Isaac in Genesis 19:1-22). In what she terms a ""feminist midrash,"" Coakley pursues the possibilities for disrupting sacrifice-as-usual (in the service of patriarchy) that the story offers.  These center around Isaac. He enters the story as powerless would-be-sacrifice from patriarch to Patriarch (at the latter's command); a position all too often associated with femininity. But he emerges from the story unscathed and utterly transformed on Coakley's reading; a position achieved not through the assertion of his own agency but through ""divine interruption"" (18) of the very logic that the story seems to instantiate. What happens, then, when we reverse the analogy between Isaac and femininity; when we read the akedah as femininity's near-sacrifice? Claiming and exercising agency in feminine form may seem the way out of patriarchy's binds, but true freedom may require instead submission to a theo-logical sacrifice of those very logics themselves, Coakley suggests. 	Saba Mahmood places front and center the provincialism of the discourse of religion's return -- and the high stakes inherent in it. On the one hand, the notion of the return of religion has little purchase on what we call ""the Muslim world"" as experienced and constituted by its native inhabitants. Yet, the trope profoundly distorts American perceptions of that world (and its inhabitants). Islam is taken to exemplify the religion that secularism sought to banish; a backward thinking source of social ills that the enlightened see (rightly) as mere illusion masquerading as power play. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are justified as offering enlightenment and emancipation to the Muslim world, a project figured primarily in and as the liberation of the (veiled) Muslim woman from religiously justified oppression. (The popularity of memoirs by and/or about Muslim women such as Reading Lolita in Tehran exhibits the power and prevalence of this [mis]perception and Americans' investment in it.) The actual interplay of religion, freedom, and oppression in the countries and cultures lumped together as ""the Muslim world"" belies this simplistic overlay on a number of levels, Mahmood argues. For one thing, Islam, like all religions, is internally multiple and diverse; some forms of it exhibit a gendered logic and practice quite opposite to that of, say, the Taliban. Reprising only briefly her account of the Egyptian women's mosque movement in The Politics of Piety: The Islamic Revival and the Feminist Subject (Princeton, 2005; recently reprinted with a new preface by the author), she notes that, even in so-called ""conservative"" forms of Islam, religious devotion often works for rather than against Muslim women's agency in and through their self-subjection to its norms. 	Feminism, Sexuality, and the Return of Religion is more than simply the sum of its parts. Taken together -- particularly as framed by the editors' introduction and the concluding roundtable -- the essays intervene in intellectually and politically significant ways in an important scene of contemporary philosophical and religious thought. Readers unfamiliar with that scene may find the reading difficult going, but those who persist will be well rewarded for their efforts.",1/16/13,10/13/16 15:45,2/22/17 18:40,10/13/16 15:45,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews,,,,,,Book review,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(eds.), Linda Martín Alcoff and John Caputo",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NM8Z33QT,journalArticle,"Review of Feminism, Sexuality and the Return of Religion",Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews

The Cost of Being Poor rectifies this problem by examining both the noneconomic and the often-overlooked economic costs faced by residents of poor urban neighborhoods in Gary, Indiana. Using census, regional, and local data, and in-depth interviews with the residents of Gary, Sandra L. Barnes argues that many people incur costs resulting from the dual dilemma of being poor and residing in a poor urban area. She explores how factors such as race/ethnicity, neighborhood type, and location influence residents' views, coping strategies, and unconventional approaches toward making ends meet. Well written and accessible, this study of Gary's poor urban neighborhoods offers broad findings that apply to other similarly impoverished Rust Belt cities.""--BOOK JACKET.",2005,5/2/14 20:09,5/2/14 20:21,,,275,,,,,The cost of being poor,"SUNY series, the new inequalities.",,,,State University of New York Press,Albany,English,,,,,OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch,,,,,,,Poor; Aspect psychologique.

Using the Urban Poverty and Family Life Survey of Chicago and bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis techniques, this study examines the degree to which neighborhood poverty constraints, household economics, and demographic variables influence positive homeownership attitudes, homeownership behavior, and neighborhood ties. It documents the presence of attitudes and behavior associated with the middle class as well as social affiliations. The findings demonstrate the greater importance of household economic conditions over neighborhood effects. Results also show that some respondents have attitudes, behavior, and, to a lesser extent, neighborhood ties similar to those found in the larger society. This evidence of continuing diversity among residents of poor urban neighborhoods suggests the need for policies more specifically tailored to the existing strengths of these neighborhoods.",2004,5/28/14 21:21,5/28/14 21:21,,41-55,,1,7,,Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eoh&AN=0772609&site=ehost-live&scope=cite,,"Measurement and Analysis of Poverty          I32; Neighborhood Characteristics          R23; Population; Regional Labor Markets; Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Housing Demand          R21; Urban, Rural, Regional, Real Estate, and Transportation Economics: Regional Migration",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,VNV3TGG7,journalArticle,"Positive Homeownership Attitudes, Homeownership Behavior, and Neighborhood Ties in Poor Urban Neighborhoods",Cityscape: A Journal of Policy Development and Research

Du Bois developed a thesis on the formation of Black manhood that includes key characteristics of this identity and dynamics that can foster or undermine its development. Yet his framework does not directly reference sexual minorities. Is Du Bois' thesis relevant today for Black men who have sex with men (BMSM)? Do they espouse similar traits and experience similar challenges? Are their masculinity tropes nuanced based on racial, gender, and/or sexual identities? Informed by a New Millennium Du Boisian Mode of Inquiry and qualitative analyses, this study considers whether and how key aspects of Du Bois' understanding of the formation of Black manhood are evident among 168 BMSM who reside in the South.

Much urban research has suggested that continual exposure to neighborhood poverty has produced attitudes and behavior that differ dramatically from these values. In this study, we examined whether residents in poor urban areas embraced these tenets of the American Dream. Based on the Urban Poverty and Family Life Survey of Chicago, logistic and multivariate analyses were used to assess the relationship of neighborhood poverty, race I ethnicity, household economics, and social variables to attitudes and behavior about home ownership and saving. The effects of “ghetto poverty” and neighborhood poverty “tipping points” were evaluated. Findings showed varying effects of race I ethnicity, neighborhood poverty, and social indicators depending on whether attitudes or behavior were under consideration. We also found that household economic status consistently was better in explaining participation in these tenets of the American Dream than variables that directly measure neighborhood poverty. © 2003 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",2003,11/22/22 16:23,11/22/22 16:23,,219-239,,3,36,,,The “american dream” in poor urban neighborhoods,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,85PR9HFQ,journalArticle,The “american dream” in poor urban neighborhoods: An analysis of home ownership attitudes and behavior and financial saving behavior*,Sociological Focus

Faith Factor 2000 Project data for seven African American denominations are used to study the role of the contemporary Black Church in addressing economic and social problems that affect the African American community. Results from bivariate and negative binomial analyses show varied denominational support of social services. The majority of sponsored programs are economic in nature or youth-oriented, rather than political or civic. Furthermore, financially stable churches with better educated, paid clergy positively influence social service sponsorship. And while variables associated with a prophetic function have a greater influence on social services, variables that reflect a more priestly function, specifically whether churches sponsor religious programs, are also important in motivating churches to provide such services. These findings add to the literature on the nuanced nature of the dialectical model used to describe the Black Church.",2004,11/22/22 16:21,11/22/22 16:21,,202-221,,2,51,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TTYCDCSN,journalArticle,Priestly and prophetic influences on black church social services,Social Problems

Presenting the theory, vision, and implementation of a socially engaged program for the Department of Human and Organizational Development (HOD) in Peabody's College of Education and Human Development at Vanderbilt University, Academics in Action! describes a more integrated model wherein students and faculty work with communities, learn from them, and bring to bear findings from theory and research to generate solutions to community problems. Offering examples of community-engaged theory, scholarship, teaching, and action, Academics in Action! describes the nuanced structures that foster and support their development within a research university. Theory and action span multiple ecological levels from individuals and small groups to organizations and social structures. The communities of engagement range from local neighborhoods and schools to arenas of national policy and international development. Reflecting the unique perspectives of research faculty, practitioners, and graduate students, Academics in Action! documents a specific philosophy of education that fosters and supports engagement; the potentially transformative nature of academic work for students, faculty, and the broader society; and some of the implications and challenges of action-oriented efforts in light of dynamics such as income inequality, racism, and global capitalism. This edited volume chronicles teaching, research, and community action that influences both inside and outside the classroom as well as presents dimensions of a participatory model that set such efforts into action. © 2016 Fordham University Press.

We consider the following research questions: Do Federation women consider themselves leaders? Are certain women more likely to consider themselves leaders than others? Results based on statistical and content analyses, and informed by leadership theory, suggest the importance of ethnicity, education, Pentecostal and mainline religious affiliations, sweat equity, and leadership interest in explaining whether women consider themselves leaders.

The book introduces seven generations of a farming family and provides an organic examination of how the family experienced life and economic challenges as one of few middle-class black families living and working alongside the many struggling black and white sharecroppers and farmers in Gallman, Mississippi. Family narratives and census data across time and a socio-ecological lens help assess how race, religion, education, and key employment options influenced economic and non-economic outcomes. Family voices explain how intangible beliefs fueled socioeconomic outcomes despite racial, gender, and economic stratification. The book also examines the effects of stratification changes across time, including: post-migration; inter- and intra-racial conflicts and compromises; and, strategic decisions and outcomes. The book provides an unexpected glimpse at how a family's ethos can foster upward mobility into the middle-class. © Sandra L.

Because the disease disproportionately affects BMSM, this emphasis is important. Yet it is also valuable to consider other dimensions of their lives. This study examines views about race and racial identity for ninety 18–24-year-old BMSM who participated in a culturally-based risk-reduction prevention program in the South. Moreover, based on its dual emphasis on oppression and resistance for marginalized groups, we consider whether and how their sentiments can be better understood using a black feminist lens. Quantitative results suggest tensions around the topic of race, but generally more affirming views about their racial identities and increased knowledge about racial issues. Qualitative findings reflect themes of identity and group affirmation and pragmatic strategies to reduce risk.

Results show that BMSM emphasize personal challenges linked to economics, bullying, stereotypes, and intra-group tensions, often under the specter of racism, that result in greater salience of their racial and/or sexual identities.

"Byrd, James P",2021,"Byrd, J.P.",978-0-19-875406-0,,,,"This chapter assesses the main strands of Edwards’s reception in North America from the eighteenth century through the early twentieth century. Most Americans did not know much, if anything, about Edwards until decades after his death, when various-often conflicting-views of Edwards appeared. New Divinity ministers expanded his theological vison while revivalists, including Charles G. Finney, enlisted Edwards’s legacy for their purposes, and thousands of evangelicals embraced Edwards’s Life of David Brainerd. Edwards intrigued (and offended) writers like Mark Twain and Harriet Beecher Stowe, and his condemnation of sin caught the interest of antislavery advocates in the Civil War. His legacy helped to shape the rise of American literature as a discipline, leading to the widespread academic study of Edwards that exploded in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, with over 5000 books, dissertations, articles, and theses published on Edwards. © Oxford University Press 2021.",2021,11/22/22 17:33,11/22/22 17:33,,463-478,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,DOI: 10.1093/oxfordhb/9780198754060.013.34,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\DPWUC6V2\display.html,,,American civil war; Charles G. finney; David brainerd; Evangelicalism; Harriet beecher stowe; Mark twain; New divinity; Revival,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,NGGU5WAX,bookSection,North America,The Oxford Handbook of Jonathan Edwards

"DeHart, Paul J.",2012,"DeHart, P.J.",978-1-136-52067-9,,,,"Aquinas and Radical Orthodoxy investigates the encounter of the most vibrant and controversial trend in recent theology with the greatest Christian thinker of the Middle Ages. The book describes Radical Orthodoxy's orientation and highlights those anti-secular strategies and intellectual influences that have shaped its appeal to Aquinas. It surveys the emergence of the particular picture of Aquinas especially associated with the leaders of Radical Orthodoxy, John Milbank and his student Catherine Pickstock, along with the scholarly disputes which prompted and followed that development. The book then undertakes a detailed investigation of the pivotal publications on Aquinas of those two authors, laying out their difficult theories in clear language, carefully examining the texts of Aquinas to which they appeal, and challenging their interpretations on a number of fundamental points. Topics covered include: analogical language and knowledge of God, the role of metaphysics within theology, the relation of cognition to the divine archetypes of things, the possibility of human apprehension of God's essence, the nature of substance, and speculation on the Trinity. The conclusion reflects on those elements suppressed by the Radical Orthodox reading of Aquinas, their constructive philosophical and theological possibilities, and the challenges they present to the Radical Orthodox project. © 2012 Taylor & Francis.

Where, then, are Americans finding meaning in their lives, if not in the context of traditional religion? In this provocative study, the authors argue that the objects of our attention have become our god and fulfilling our desires has become our religion. They examine the religious dimensions of six specific aspects of American culture - body and sex, big business, entertainment, politics, sports, and science and technology - that function as ""altars"" where Americans gather to worship and produce meaning for their lives. The Altars Where We Worship shows how these secular altars provide resources for understanding the self, others, and the world itself. ""For better or worse,"" the authors write, ""we are faced with the reality that human experiences before these altars contain religious characteristics in common with experiences before more traditional altars."" Readers will come away with a clearer understanding of what religion is after exploring the thoroughly religious aspects of popular culture in the United States. - from publisher.",2016,6/11/20 18:48,6/11/20 18:48,,,,,,,,The altars where we worship,,,,,Westminster John Knox Press,"Louisville, Kentucky",eng,,,,,catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,United States; Religious aspects; Christianity; Christianity and culture; Popular culture,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,First edition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DQ6S7SLN,book,The altars where we worship: the religious significance of popular culture,

Floyd-Thomas’s chapter, “The Good, the m.A.A.d., and the Holy: Kendrick Lamar’s Meditations on Sin and Moral Agency in the Post-Gangsta Era,” examines the ways in which Lamar grapples with notions of sin on both an individual and a communal basis within the African American experience. Here Floyd-Thomas argues the most consistent and unwavering facet of Lamar’s work has been his incisive commentary and musing on the cumulative impact immoral and ‘illicit’ acts have had on his generation born and raised in the shadow of gangsta rap’s emergence within the global cultural milieu. Exploring the relevance of ‘West Coast’ sensibilities as fomenters of Lamar’s interest in morality, alongside thorough analysis drawing parallels with St. Augustine, Floyd-Thomas presents Lamar as a marker of the contemporary complexities concerning making right-action in a world with so little of it and leaves readers with the impression that, at the very least, Lamar is honest enough to help navigate the moral terrain. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Christopher M.

Where, then, are Americans finding meaning in their lives, if not in the context of traditional religion? In this provocative study, the authors argue that the objects of our attention have become our god and fulfilling our desires has become our religion. They examine the religious dimensions of six specific aspects of American culture - body and sex, big business, entertainment, politics, sports, and science and technology - that function as ""altars"" where Americans gather to worship and produce meaning for their lives. The Altars Where We Worship shows how these secular altars provide resources for understanding the self, others, and the world itself. ""For better or worse,"" the authors write, ""we are faced with the reality that human experiences before these altars contain religious characteristics in common with experiences before more traditional altars."" Readers will come away with a clearer understanding of what religion is after exploring the thoroughly religious aspects of popular culture in the United States. - from publisher., $$Cbibliography_note$$VIncludes bibliographical references and index.",2016,2/13/18 19:00,2/13/18 19:00,,,,,,,,The altars where we worship,,,,,Westminster John Knox Press,"Louisville, Kentucky",eng,,,,,discoverlibrary.vanderbilt.edu,BR115 .C8 F563 2016,,,,,,United States; Christianity and culture United States; Christianity and culture; nne United States Popular culture; Popular culture; Popular culture Religious aspects Christianity; Popular culture United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,First edition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,KXXWBK7J,book,The altars where we worship: the religious significance of popular culture,

Floyd-Thomas,978-1-978711-37-2,,,,"In 'Resisting Occupation', international scholars discuss the radical denial of human flourishing caused by the occupation of mind, body, spirit, and land. They explore how religious perspectives can be, and often are, constructed by occupiers to justify their actions, perpetuate exploitation, and domesticate indigenous landholders. In the name of Christianization and civilization, which has proven to be a global phenomenon beyond time and space, a consistent domestication process is established. The colonized are taught to want, to yearn for, and to embrace their occupation, seeing themselves through the eyes of their colonizers. Writing from different spots around the globe, the scholars of this book demonstrate how occupation, a synonym for empire, is manifested within their social context and reveal unity in their struggle for liberation. Recognizing that where there is oppression, there is resistance, the contributors turn to religion. While questioning the logic, rationale, theology, and epistemology of the empire?s religion, they nonetheless seek the liberative response of resistance ? at times using the very religion of the occupiers. 0.",2020,6/30/21 16:42,6/30/21 16:42,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lexington Books,Lexington,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1151889772,,,,,,"Torre, Miguel de la; Raheb, Mitri",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,TT3H5Y69,bookSection,The Devil that Occupies US: Social Sin and Sacred Silence in a Trumped Era,Resisting occupation.

The particular dynamics emerging from the coronavirus pandemic have been felt most intensely by America’s most vulnerable populations, who are disproportionately people of color and the working poor, the people whom the Bible refers to as “the least of these.” This book makes the case that the pandemic was not just a medical phenomenon, or an economic or social one, but also a religious one. Religious practice has been altered in profound ways. Controversies around religious freedom have been re-ignited over debates concerning whether government can restrict church services.

Focusing on the nonhuman-animal constructions of primarily Germanophone authors, including Sigmund Freud, Heinrich Heine, Franz Kafka, and Gertrud Kolmar, Jay Geller expands his earlier examinations (On Freud's Jewish Body: Mitigating Circumcisions and The Other Jewish Question: Identifying the Jew and Making Sense of Modernity) of how such writers drew upon representations of Jewish corporeality in order to work through their particular situations in Gentile modernity. From Heine's ironic lizards to Kafka's Red Peter and Siodmak's Wolf Man, this book brings together Jewish cultural studies and critical animal studies to ferret out these writers' engagement with the bestial answers upon which the Jewish and animal questions converged and by which varieties of the species ""Jew"" were identified., Central copy: Shelved in Vanderbilt Authors’ Room, 418A Central Heard Library., $$Cbibliography_note$$VIncludes bibliographical references (pages 341-384) and index.",2018,1/11/18 22:03,1/11/18 22:03,,,,,,,,Bestiarium Judaicum,,,,,Fordham University Press,New York,eng,,,,,discoverlibrary.vanderbilt.edu,DS143 .G353 2018,,,,,,"Antisemitism; Animals Symbolic aspects; Anti-Jewish attitudes; Anti-Semitism; Identity, Jewish; Jewish identity; Jewishness; Jews Ethnic identity; Jews Identity History 19th century; Jews Identity History 20th century; Jews Race identity; Metaphor in literature; nne Symbolism of animals; Symbolic aspects of animals",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,First edition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DMJCMDD4,book,Bestiarium Judaicum:  unnatural histories of the Jews,

Each chapter introduces the topic, identifies key theorists and issues, and respects the pluralistic nature of the scholarship in the field.

Drawing on Jewish history, literary studies, folklore, art history and the history of science, it examines both the historical depiction of Jews as monsters and the creative use of monstrous beings in Jewish culture. Jews have occupied a liminal position within European society and culture, being deeply immersed yet outsiders to it. For this reason, they were perceived in terms of otherness and were often represented as monstrous beings. However, at the same time, European Jews invoked, with tantalizing ubiquity, images of magical, terrifying and hybrid beings in their texts, art and folktales. These images were used by Jewish authors and artists to push back against their own identification as monstrous or diabolical and to tackle concerns about religious persecution, assimilation and acculturation, gender and sexuality, science and technology and the rise of antisemitism. Bringing together an impressive cast of contributors from around the world, this fascinating volume is an invaluable resource for academics, postgraduates and advanced undergraduates interested in Jewish studies, as well as the history of monsters.""-",2019,6/11/20 18:50,6/11/20 18:50,,251-64,,,,,,,,,,,Bloomsbury,London/New York,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1105060702,,,,,,"Idelson-Shein, Iris; Wiese, Christian",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,D94SK4RY,bookSection,‘Der Volf’ or the Jew as Out(side of the)law,Monsters and monstrosity in Jewish history: from the Middle Ages to modernity

Migrating people reflect the imago Dei of God the Earthroamer. Unlike God, humans do not always move with freedom as geopolitical forces, from societal disintegration to war and climate change, force migration. The experiences within migration reflect elements of a “personal knowledge” (Michael Polanyi). This essay recognizes that much of the migrating experience may escape verbalization, which not only impacts migrating people but also the scholars and researchers studying migration. Drawing on narratives in the Judeo-Christian tradition, the essay identifies seven pastoral-theological polarities to describe the migrating experience: Anticipation and disappointment; trouble and restoration; curse and blessing; at home and being a stranger; becoming and continuity of being; articulation and silence; and alone and in communitas. These themes are illuminated by pastoral-theological, cultural, psychological, and psychodynamic theories.",4/19/22,6/29/22 18:31,6/29/22 18:31,6/29/22 18:31,,,,,,Pastoral Psychol,,,,,,,,en,,,,,Springer Link,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\PT8DH6RK\Hamman - 2022 - A Brief Pastoral Topography for Migrating People.pdf,,,Earthroamer; Imago Dei; Michael Polanyi; Migrating people; Personal knowledge; Transcultural identity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,QMJMDUMV,journalArticle,A Brief Pastoral Topography for Migrating People,Pastoral Psychology

"Hudnut-Beumler, Jim",,"Hudnut-Beumler, James",,,,http://www.researchonreligion.org/christianity/james-hudnut-beumler-on-religion-in-the-now-south,"When you think if Christianity in the U.S. South, images of Southern Baptist congregations, conservative politics, and even snake-handling may come to mind.  But Prof. James Hudnut-Beumler, the Anne Potter Wilson Distinguished Professor of American Religious History at Vanderbilt University, reveals that the spiritual tapestry is much more nuanced than might appear on initial glance.  Prof. Hudnut-Beumler joins us to talk about his new book Strangers and Friends at the Welcome Table and reveals how several historical traditions have persisted in the region while significant transformations are also taking place. We commence with a discussion of a definition of “the South,” which can be viewed geographically (starting just below Northern Virginia, running down to the top portion of Florida, and extending westward to Arkansas and encompassing the southern portions of Indiana and Illinois) and spiritually (those areas with a majority Southern Baptist population).  Jim explains how this decade-long process took him on a “r0ad trip” around the region to experience the lives and institutions of those living in what he calls the “Now South,” a region with deep roots to its “Old Time Religion” past, but which is also changing in surprising ways.  Looking at the historical roots first, we discuss how religion, food, and hospitality are intimately linked via kinship networks and a concern over scarcity being a daily lived experience.  Food and visitation are viewed as an expression of love for folks who are ill, imprisoned, or otherwise facing difficult times.  Jim also notes that food and hospitality also becomes a basis for various types of social activism as such community involvement is often viewed as a measure of piety.  Sometimes such activism can take on hard-nosed policies towards drug addicts who are allowed assistance only if they quickly accept Jesus, or in more open terms that seek to get mentally ill individuals the help they need.  We also chat about how Pentecostalism, technically a very small fraction of Southern Christians, has influenced the Christianity of the region, often leading to “Bapticostal” congregations that call their ministers bishops and have multiple offerings.  Religion also manifests itself along racial lines in the South, as one might expect, and Jim talks about religiously-infused racial histories can wound but also offer up possibilities for forgiveness.  He raises the horrific shooting at the Charleston Emmanuel AME Church in 2015 as an example of these racial divides and how the power of forgiveness is used not necessarily to “forgive and forget,” but to heal tragedies so it doesn’t wound the victims continuously. The conversation then moves in the direction of the “Now South” and the new trends that have been reshaping the spiritual landscape over the past several decades.  We look at how megachurches are setting new standards of worship not only for congregants in the suburbs, but in smaller rural and urban churches as well.  Jim points out how the growth of homeschooling has responded to the integration of private religious schools (often called “segregation academies”).  The growth of Catholicism with the influx of immigrants from Mexico and Central America has also diversified the religious tapestry of the region.  And finally, we discuss the surprising increase in the number of congregations that have taken a welcoming position to the LGBT communities and how it has roiled the waters.  Jim explains that while it is easy to preach hate, the culture is changing via kinship ties and the “power of one” wherein one individual can help to change the views of those around them.  While still a very small minority of churches, the presence of LGBT-friendly congregations indicate progressive steps forward. We finish off by asking Prof. Hudnut-Beumler what he would tell a younger version of Jim if he had the chance to travel back in time.  The elder Jim provides some interesting words of advice for his younger self recognizing that things you never thought would have made an impression early on often come back to you as new opportunities for exploration and learning.

This is the phenomenon explored exceedingly well by William D. Moore in Shaker Fever, a book that, like the Shaker enthusiasts themselves, tells us more about the middle decades of the twentieth century than about the Shakers.First came the collectors, who simply wanted to possess historically significant objects, or, like the driven Faith Andrews and Edward Deming Andrews, wanted to be the leading experts on the Shakers through their material culture. Soon came the artists and designers, who saw in Shaker furniture and objects the foretaste of modern design's clean lines and emphasis on use. Then came dramatic and dance productions that performed the Shakers, often with sexual undertones or romantic angst that reflected feelings the artists projected on Shaker men and women. Next came John Williams, a wealthy stockbroker who loved the clever innovations of the sect's members and established the Shaker Museum and Library in Old Chatham, New York. Meanwhile, Yale University academics who envisioned the Shakers as a counterweight to the Soviet Union and as an example of how American culture would prevail in the Cold War, sought to bring the Andrews's collection permanently to the university's fine arts museum. (Americanists will particularly be interested in the intrigue and ideas at the center of the founding of American studies in this chapter.) Also, during the Cold War, an old Shaker village in upstate New York was repurposed for a secular work camp to teach adolescents how to do honest manual labor and perform Shaker music. As it evolved, this latter activity, divorced from the underlying piety, did not find favor with the Shakers. Finally, the remaining Shakers opened some of their villages to the public to tell their own story and to financially support their continued existence.",3/1/22,6/30/22 19:47,6/30/22 19:48,6/30/22 19:47,858-859,,4,108,,Journal of American History,Shaker Fever,,,,,,,,,,,,Silverchair,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\FXWZ8N5L\Hudnut-Beumler - 2022 - Shaker Fever America's Twentieth-Century Fascinat.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\YULMAC8R\6564960.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UXDLD7JK,journalArticle,Book Review of Shaker Fever: America's Twentieth-Century Fascination with a Communitarian Sect,Journal of American History

The process reveals a continual effort by all generations to respond to their own particular situations both through recourse to the past and through creative engagement with their present circumstances.  Moral values are thus seen to emerge as moral problems are faced, and the literary traditions convey these values from one period to the next.  Using the succession narrative as an example, this essay analyzes the different roles played first by the predecessor generation and then later by the successor generation in the use of tradition to affect moral conduct.   Such a process of moral determination throughout the course of biblical history, it is suggested, can be seen as a precedent of the ways in which Jewish ethics in the postcanonical period draws creatively and critically on biblical norms and principles.

In this he made use of an approach which sought to relate the literary expressions to the respective periods and institutions from which they stemmed.  Paramount in this regard was the identification of the presuppositions and Tendenz of each piece.  For critical reasons he avoided such stages as oral tradition where the historian would be on insecure ground. Throughout the Prolegomena Wellhausen exhibited a clear preference for the early literature in matters of both style and spirit, and he did not hesitate to criticize forcefully the literary developments of the postexilic period.

"Knight, Douglas A.",2011,"Levine, Amy-Jill; Knight, Douglas A.",978-0-06-112175-3,,,,"""The Hebrew Scriptures, or ""Old Testament"" as Christians call it, has given the world some of the greatest literature known. With this fresh introduction, cutting-edge biblical scholars bring ancient Israel to brilliant Technicolor life. Readers will learn of unlikely heroes and courageous women, royal intrigues and slave rebellions, doubtful prophets and lovesick poets, bloody battles and miraculous triumphs. These retellings will delight observant Jews, faithful Christians, world historians and readers of great literature. Passed down for centuries as spoken stories, compiled around 450 BCE, and finalized probably around the time of Jesus, the various books of the Hebrew Bible took shape under a variety of cultures and time periods, influencing the formation of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The authors open our eyes to this diverse history shedding new meaning on well-worn texts. They point out how the Hebrew Bible has continually shaped society, and how our own cultural circumstances influence how we interpret it today. The authors highlight the Biblical themes with which readers continue to wrestle: human evil and God's response; war and peace; law and society; politics and economics; belief and practice; women and sexuality; Israel and the Nations; practical wisdom and apocalyptic vision. As relevant today as it was 2,500 years ago, Knight and Levine will open the reader's eyes to the riches of one of the greatest collections of literature known to humankind""--",2011,10/30/14 14:28,7/17/18 18:16,,,473,,,,,The meaning of the Bible,,,,,HarperOne,New York,eng,,,,,Primo,BS1173.3 .K55 2011,,,,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rfh&AN=ATLA0001930367&site=ehost-live&scope=cite,,"Biblical Hermeneutics; Bible.

"Levine, Amy-Jill",2005,"Levine, Amy-Jill",,0792-6049,,,"There are some nice things to say about this book. [David Klinghoffer Doubleday], a conservative columnist for the Jewish weekly Forward, and one of the United States' more public Jews who have made the journey to Orthodoxy, has a lucid and witty style. He corrects many a misunderstanding about Judaism, refutes Christian arguments that both Jesus and support for his messianic role can be found in classical Jewish sources, and delineates the various reasons why Jews have not accepted Christian claims. He offers the correct, timely and trenchant observations that too many Jews have too little familiarity with their own texts, history or theology, that Jews are often embarrassed by the particularities of traditional beliefs and practices, and that the American Jewish ""secular leadership"" creates unnecessary fear by condemning the growing voice of Evangelical Christians. Klinghoffer does not fear offending his readers, and offense may well be the reaction to his portraits of Jesus and Paul. His Jesus is a foxy, highly conflicted healer, but healing does not, as Klinghoffer shows, a messiah make. Jesus fails to win the loyalty of the majority of Jews who encounter him - whether in his time or subsequently - because he fails to fulfill any major messianic expectations, such as ingathering the exiles or establishing eternal peace. His initial followers were easily duped Galileans famous for their lack of Torah-knowledge and easily taken in by this phenomenally charismatic teacher, who entertained extravagant notions about his own role in history. Finally, Jesus is an apikorus, a Jew who knowingly and willfully rejects the tradition of the Rabbis (the Oral Law). Any Jew who converts to Christianity, from [Paul] onward, is thus, Klinghoffer implies, not only an ignoramus taken in by dubious Biblical arguments, but also a dupe and a dope who knows nothing about Judaism. Whereas Klinghoffer's typical Christians are neurotic, for ""some part of the Christian soul would always be disturbed by the apprehension, however suppressed, that the Jews were right,"" the Jewish psyche is not afflicted by the complementary neurosis (it's nice to know we've escaped one): Jews do not worry that maybe Christians are right. We couldn't: After all, their teachings fail on both textual and philosophical grounds, and, moreover, the souls of Jews are programmed differently.",7/11/05,6/21/18 17:35,6/21/18 17:35,,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,eng,,,,,discoverlibrary.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,"Doubleday, David Klinghoffer",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WI5INWK8,journalArticle,With Friends Like David Klinghoffer...,The Jerusalem Report

Leading scholars provide extensive overviews of key topics, offering analyses of the trajectory and reception history of theological issues as well as critical assessment of Near Eastern and Greco-Roman antecedents for Old and New Testament perspectives. While many entries address the Bible's historical context, including traditional theological perspectives on creation, sin, covenant, grace, and forgiveness, others are more rooted in modern issues, featuring biblical perspectives on contemporary concerns such as wealth and poverty, gender/race discrimination, and market economics. The two-volume OEBT contains 168 entries ranging in length from 2,000 to 8,000 words. With bibliographic references and suggestions for further reading, each entry affords students and scholars a comprehensive topical and methodological summary of the topic that serves as both a go-to reference and a starting point for original research.

[David Klinghoffer Doubleday], a conservative columnist for the Jewish weekly Forward, and one of the United States' more public Jews who have made the journey to Orthodoxy, has a lucid and witty style. He corrects many a misunderstanding about Judaism, refutes Christian arguments that both Jesus and support for his messianic role can be found in classical Jewish sources, and delineates the various reasons why Jews have not accepted Christian claims. He offers the correct, timely and trenchant observations that too many Jews have too little familiarity with their own texts, history or theology, that Jews are often embarrassed by the particularities of traditional beliefs and practices, and that the American Jewish ""secular leadership"" creates unnecessary fear by condemning the growing voice of Evangelical Christians. Klinghoffer does not fear offending his readers, and offense may well be the reaction to his portraits of Jesus and Paul. His Jesus is a foxy, highly conflicted healer, but healing does not, as Klinghoffer shows, a messiah make. Jesus fails to win the loyalty of the majority of Jews who encounter him - whether in his time or subsequently - because he fails to fulfill any major messianic expectations, such as ingathering the exiles or establishing eternal peace. His initial followers were easily duped Galileans famous for their lack of Torah-knowledge and easily taken in by this phenomenally charismatic teacher, who entertained extravagant notions about his own role in history. Finally, Jesus is an apikorus, a Jew who knowingly and willfully rejects the tradition of the Rabbis (the Oral Law). Any Jew who converts to Christianity, from [Paul] onward, is thus, Klinghoffer implies, not only an ignoramus taken in by dubious Biblical arguments, but also a dupe and a dope who knows nothing about Judaism. Whereas Klinghoffer's typical Christians are neurotic, for ""some part of the Christian soul would always be disturbed by the apprehension, however suppressed, that the Jews were right,"" the Jewish psyche is not afflicted by the complementary neurosis (it's nice to know we've escaped one): Jews do not worry that maybe Christians are right. We couldn't: After all, their teachings fail on both textual and philosophical grounds, and, moreover, the souls of Jews are programmed differently.",7/11/05,11/7/16 15:54,11/7/16 15:54,11/7/16 15:54,41,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,(Copyright (c) 2005.

Her numerous works, including ""Israeli Women: the Reality Behind the Myth"" (1978), ""Where Mountains Roar: A Personal Report from the Negev and Sinai Desert"" (1980), and ""Jerusalem Jerusalem,"" her 1986 memoir of her life in Israel in the 1970s and 80s, reveal her psychological expertise and an understanding for the complexities of her subjects. Plus, this British-born psychologist and journalist is a splendid writer. Surely, this ""Jew who once seriously considered becoming a rabbi,"" ""former convent schoolgirl who daydreamed about being a nun,"" and ""agnostic with a deep sense of religious mystery though no affinity for organized religion,"" as she describes herself in the book's introduction, would envision a [Mary] who would resonate with readers from diverse religious backgrounds; surely she would bring her knowledge of today's Middle East to bear on recreating life at the turn of the Christian Era, but, given her historical care, would do so without sliding into anachronism. In large measure, she succeeds. While Hazleton does not, and could not, present a definitive Maryam, as [Jesus]' mother is known in Aramaic, her informed portrait (the bibliography runs to 12 pages) not only avoids the historical nonsense that marks so many studies of Jesus, but is also intellectually as well as aesthetically compelling. It recollects the Great Virgin, the Magna Mater, Isis -- other mother goddesses who hold the power of fertility and whose paradoxical identifications as virgin and mother transcend the mundanely physical. The title ""virgin"" signifies power, not physical attribute. This biography does consider whether Maryam was raped, and one scenario has her raped by a priest and so serves to explain Jesus' enmity toward the Temple. Although Hazleton eventually concludes that Jesus' father is Mary's husband, Joseph, (whom she, in line with a growing trend in New Testament studies today, posits was from Bethlehem of the Galilee, not Judea), her passionate insistence that ""the idea of rape does no dishonor either to Maryam or to her son"" should be required reading for all victims of sexual abuse. As for the popular question -- made even more popular with the controversy surrounding the reputed ossuary of Jesus' brother [James] -- of whether Mary had other children, Hazleton does propose that the ""brothers and sisters"" mentioned in the Gospels are not Mary's children. Her reasons, however, have nothing to do with the theological claim that Mary remained a virgin pre partum, in partu and post partum, and everything to do with first-century life. Hazleton's major target is the Temple. In her reconstruction, Galileans saw the Judean temple as a corruption of Israelite values and faith. The ""real revolution of the Jesus movement"" was the replacement of the Temple with the individual, the exchange of a system promoting hierarchy and wealth by one that drew no distinction between man and woman, sinner or saint, rich or poor. A glance at the Gospels corrects such reductionism: Joseph and Mary visit the Temple for sacrifice and pilgrimage, as did other Galileans. The Temple welcomed both saint and sinner, as Jesus' parable of the Pharisee and Tax Collector (Luke 18:9-14) demonstrates; it welcomed poor and rich, Jew and gentile. The leadership may have been corrupt, and [Herod]'s turning the Temple into a Hellenized tourist attraction an abomination, but even Galileans respected the institution, and Jesus' followers, including his mother, continued to worship there.",5/17/04,11/7/16 15:50,11/7/16 15:50,11/7/16 15:50,38,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,(Copyright (c) 2004.

Less well known is that the film contains references to what was, at the time of its release, cutting edge biblical scholarship and Life of Jesus research. This research, founded on the acceptance of the Historical Jesus as a Jew who needs to be understood within the context of his time, is implicitly referenced through the setting of the Brian character within a tumultuous social and political background. This collection is a compilation of essays from foremost scholars of the historical Jesus and the first century Judaea, and includes contributions from George Brooke, Richard Burridge, Paula Fredriksen, Steve Mason, Adele Reinhartz, Bart Ehrman, Amy-Jill Levine, James Crossley, Philip Davies, Joan Taylor, Bill Telford, Helen Bond, Guy Steibel, David Tollerton, David Shepherd and Katie Turner. The collection opens up the Life of Brian to renewed investigation and, in so doing, uses the film to reflect on the historical Jesus and his times, revitalising the discussion of history and Life of Jesus research.

Once implacable theological foes, the two traditions have travelled a great distance in coming to view the other with respect and dignity. Responding to the horrors of Auschwitz, the Catholic Church has undergone a “reckoning of the soul,” beginning with its landmark document Nostra Aetate and embraced a positive theology of Judaism including the ongoing validity of the Jewish covenant. Jews have responded to this unprecedented outreach, especially in the document Dabru Emet. Together, these two Abrahamic traditions have begun seeking a repair of the world. The road has been rocky and certainly obstacles remain.

Here's what we know, in seven points, about these Jews whom churches traditionally see as representing everything Jesus came to correct, and whom synagogues traditionally see as representing the faithful transmission of our beautiful tradition. 1 Contrary to the dominant Christian view, the Pharisees were not generally wealthy. The term ""Pharisee"" generally drops out of rabbinic sources, perhaps because the separation from the Sadducees became de facto when the temple, the locus of Sadducean authority, was destroyed in 70 C.E. 5Pharisees promoted the idea that free will was an essential component of creation, although they also recognized divine control.",2015-03,11/3/16 20:06,11/3/16 20:08,11/3/16 20:06,26-29,,3,44,,,,,,,,,,English,Copyright Sojourners Mar 2015,,,,ProQuest,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\EKUUX5VP\Levine - 2015 - Quit Picking on the Pharisees!.pdf,,,Judaism; Religions And Theology; Christianity; Jews,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IH3JQIN2,magazineArticle,Quit Picking on the Pharisees!,Sojourners Magazine

As its editors, we were attentive to how the book would be perceived by a readership that, for various reasons, might find the volume at best odd, at worst scandalous. We conceived of and edited the volume with three main audiences in mind: Christians who wanted to know more about the Jewish background of the New Testament; Jews who had little familiarity with the New Testament; and readers from any background who were curious about the New Testament in its original historical matrix. In this essay we discuss our goals in writing the commentary for these audiences, such as overturning Christian stereotypes of Jews and Judaism and Jewish stereotypes of Christians and Christianity, and showing Jewish and Christian readers a part of their intertwined history. We also discuss the book's reception, which has been largely positive in Jewish and Christian communities and classrooms, despite acerbic and even frightening reviews and blog posts by a handful of readers.",2014,11/3/16 19:39,11/3/16 19:39,11/3/16 19:39,1-7,,,11,,,The Jewish Annotated New Testament,,,,,,,English,"Copyright Centre for Jewish Studies, University of Manchester 2014",,,,ProQuest,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\XPK5Q7QA\1.html,,,Judaism; Bible; Christianity; New Testament; Religions And Theology--Judaic,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E4CDUETC,journalArticle,The Jewish Annotated New Testament: Retrospect and Prospects,Melilah

With this fresh introduction, cutting-edge biblical scholars bring ancient Israel to brilliant Technicolor life. Readers will learn of unlikely heroes and courageous women, royal intrigues and slave rebellions, doubtful prophets and lovesick poets, bloody battles and miraculous triumphs. These retellings will delight observant Jews, faithful Christians, world historians and readers of great literature. Passed down for centuries as spoken stories, compiled around 450 BCE, and finalized probably around the time of Jesus, the various books of the Hebrew Bible took shape under a variety of cultures and time periods, influencing the formation of Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The authors open our eyes to this diverse history shedding new meaning on well-worn texts. They point out how the Hebrew Bible has continually shaped society, and how our own cultural circumstances influence how we interpret it today. The authors highlight the Biblical themes with which readers continue to wrestle: human evil and God's response; war and peace; law and society; politics and economics; belief and practice; women and sexuality; Israel and the Nations; practical wisdom and apocalyptic vision.

Weighing in at 715 pages, The Gospel of Luke by Amy-Jill Levine and Ben Witherington III is a part of the New Cambridge Bible Commentary series. It does all of the things a full commentary should, but it also contains a series of friendly arguments in written form between an evangelical Methodist scholar and an agnostic feminist Jewish scholar who attends an Orthodox synagogue but describes herself as “often quite unorthodox.” They disagree on Luke’s attitude towards Judaism, his view of women, and sometimes his meaning or sources. But there’s also a lot these two distinguished scholars agree on. In this wide-ranging discussion we focus on this book’s origin, their agreements and disagreements, mistaken anti-Jewish readings of Luke, their opposition to replacement theology readings of Luke or Paul, radical views about the gospels such as mythicism, ancient anti-Marcionism and Luke 1-2, Luke’s anti-docetism, and the genre, authorship, style, and dating of this famous gospel.

However, at the time of the transition from the 20th to the 21st century the dialogues were marked by disillusionment and disappointment due to the fact that not enough progress was experienced with regard to concrete everyday issues. Moreover theoretical points of disagreement remained obstacles for a real mutual understanding, the major ones being the interpretation of certain Biblical passages (esp. John 14:6 and 15:26) and their implications for Christology and the theology of the Trinity. This book explores ""new hermeneutics for renewed dialogues."" To use a metaphor found in the book, the contributions of this volume are suggesting ""new songs"" with regard to the dialogues by proposing a future-oriented hermeneutics and a shift from an exclusive focus on Christology to including Pneumatology and thus the doctrine of the Trinity. By so doing the authors and editors intend to offer a new impetus and a new elan in Roman Catholic-Eastern Orthodox as well as Christian-Jewish dialogues. The co-authors of this book contribute pneumatological hermeneutical insights from their respective Protestant, (Christian) Orthodox, Roman Catholic and Jewish perspectives.",4/26/19,6/11/20 18:53,6/11/20 18:53,,,,,,,,,,,,,Peeters,,en,Could not import appropiate citation from library website,,,,Google Books,,Google-Books-ID: d5WyxQEACAAJ,,,https://books.google.com/books?id=d5WyxQEACAAJ,,,"Bieringer, Reimund; Ibita, Ma Marilou S.; Mey, Peter De; Pollefeyt, Didier",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,8C5QZRF9,bookSection,"Four Questions on the Trinity, Pneumatology, and Jewish-Christian Relations","The Spirit, Hermeneutics, and Dialogues"

The reach of this volume therefore goes beyond that of most feminist studies of Revelation, which frequently focus on the female imagery: the Thyatiran prophet called 'Jezebel', the 'Woman Clothed with the Sun', the 'Whore of Babylon', and the 'Bride'/the 'Heavenly Jerusalem'. The symbols of Revelation remain open and interpetations continue. Some readers will refuse to rejoice at the dismemberment of the Woman-who-is-Babylon; they will resist the (masochistic? infantile?) self-abasement before this imperial Deity who rules by patriarchal domination. Others will conclude that these descriptions are 'only' metaphors, separate form from substance, and worship the transcendent to which the metaphors imperfectly point.  Some readers will understand, if not fully condone, John's rhetoric by seeking his political and social location; others will condone, if not fully understand, how the Apocalypse can provide comfort to those undergoing persecution or deprivation. Some readers may reject the coercive aspects of a choice between spending eternity in praise of the divine or being 'tortured' with fire and sulfer; others may rejoice in their own salvation while believing that those being tortured deserve every pain inflicting upon them; still others may use mimicry or parody or anachronistic analogy to challenge, defang, or replace John's message. What we find behind the veil may be beautiful, or terrifying, or both, but we cannot avert our eyes: John's vision is too influential today, in our own political climate, not to look for ourselves. The Feminist Companion to the Apocalypse of John includes contributions by David L. Barr, Mary Ann Beavis, Greg Carey, Adela Yarbro Collins, Lynn R. Huber, Catherine Keller, John Marshall, Stephen Moore, Jorunn Økland, Hanna Stenström, Pamela Thimmes, and Carolyn Vander Stichele. There is an introduction by Amy-Jill Levine and a comprehensive bibliography.",,10/31/16 20:02,8/10/20 14:40,10/31/16 20:02,,,,,,,,Feminist companion to the New Testament and early Christian writings ; 5,,,,Bloomsbury Publishing,,,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\VPNEDZEU\a-feminist-companion-to-the-apocalypse-of-john-9780826466518.html,,,,"Levine, Amy-Jill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,86R8N2NF,book,A Feminist Companion to the Apocalypse of John,

"Levine, Amy-Jill",2007,"Levine, A.-J.",978-1-932792-72-0,,,,"The third gospel's presentation of the Pharisees is ""puzzling,"" 1 lacking consistency,2 ""complex,"" 3 and ""disputed.""4 Whether approached primarily by literary or by historical questions, Luke's Pharisees elude clear answers. The reasons for this confusion are several, of which the following four are major. First, the relationship between this gospel and the Acts of the Apostles, Luke's second volume, complicates assessment of figures that appear in both texts. Pharisees in Acts include Gamaliel, ""a teacher of the Law, respected by all the people,"" Gamaliel's student Paul, ""a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees"" (5:34; 23:6), ""believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees"" (15:5), and ""the scribes of the Pharisees' group"" (23:9). However, the Pharisees in Acts similarly elude definitive assessment: is Gamaliel admirable because he cautions against persecuting Jesus' followers or the villainous mentor of the arch-persecutor Paul? Do Pharisees demonstrate Scriptural fidelity or do they block the Holy Spirit by insisting Gentile Christians follow the Mosaic Law? Moreover, their depictions impact any assessment of the Gospel of Luke if one seeks a consistent presentation.5 Second, source-critical questions remain uncertain. Most New Testament scholars propose that Luke relied on both Mark's gospel and a (hypothetical) source shared with Matthew, labeled Q. A minority of scholars argue that Luke directly depended on Matthew and that Mark is a conflation of Matthew and Luke. Assessment of Luke's sources impacts understanding of Luke's Pharisees. Assessed in terms of Markan priority, Luke adds references to Pharisees in 5:17; 7:30; 7:36; 11:53; 13:31; 14:1, 3; 16:14; 17:20; and 18:10-14. Compared to Mark and Matthew, Luke highlights the Pharisees' love of money and their rejection of Jesus' association with tax collectors and sinners. But Luke lacks the odd Matthean (27:62) combination of ""chief priests and Pharisees,"" for Luke mentions no Pharisees in the Passion narrative. Absent is Mark's note that the chief priests, scribes, and elders (Mark 11:27) sent ""Pharisees and Herodians"" (12:13) to trap Jesus; Luke speaks only of ""spies"" who pretended to be righteous (dikaivou~; 20:20). Did Luke suppress this information? Was Luke aware of it? Third, Luke's historical and social contexts remain speculative. The Pharisees may represent ""Jewish Christians"" of Luke's own day.6 Or, they may be ahistorical foils designed to teach the author's audience by negative example. The invectives may be conventional (hypocrites, lovers of money), with no basis in reality. Or, they may reflect the redactor's use of sources, themselves of unclear historical worth. Nor are these options mutually exclusive. Further complicating this issue: scholars have yet to reach any firm agreement on the composition of the intended audience or the identity of the author: Gentile (the most common identification), proselyte, God-fearer, Jew. Finally, all readers bring to the text their own presuppositions and values. Some interpreters find Pharisaic presence implied where Luke mentions none and ascribe to Pharisees implied concerns that Luke does not note. Some begin with the view that all Pharisees are the same; others conclude that these figures should be assessed as individuals, like the Gentiles and the Twelve.7 In recognition of such considerations, this essay takes the following steps. First, it looks at Luke's gospel apart from Acts. Second, it does not emphasize possible redactional changes. Third, eschewing reconstruction of Luke's social context, it focuses on the narrative: what the gospel's Pharisees do and how the narrator describes them. Finally, to enable readers to assess the data themselves, it addresses each pericope in which the Pharisees appear rather than organizing the information into categories, such as ""Sabbath observance,"" ""economic status,"" or ""table fellowship"". © 2007 by Baylor University Press.",2007,11/22/22 20:34,11/22/22 20:34,,113-130,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\FY49QK65\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMMTKZML,bookSection,Luke's pharisees,In Quest of the Historical Pharisees

"Lim, Paul",2008,"Coffey, J.; Lim, P.C.H.",,,10.1017/CCOL9780521860888.001,,"In 1564, or thereabouts, the English discovered a new term of abuse - 'Puritan'. Initially, it was an insult launched at nonconformist clergy within the newly reformed Elizabethan church, zealous Protestants who refused to wear prescribed liturgical vestments, particularly the white surplice, and who gained a reputation as 'opposers of the hierarchy and church-service'. But soon the nickname was taken up by 'profane mouths', who deployed it rather indiscriminately 'to abuse pious people'. 'Puritan' became a handy smear word for bishops angered by clerical nonconformity, metropolitan playwrights provoked by censorious moralism, and villagers driven to distraction by assaults on traditional festive culture. By the early seventeenth century, Patrick Collinson explains, 'Puritanism' had become 'the brand name for a certain kind of Protestant religiosity, social conduct and politics'. The polemical origins of the term have troubled historians, and led some to call for the abolition of Puritanism as a historical category. Yet for most scholars of early modern England and New England, the concept has proved indispensable. As the American historian Michael Winship explains, Puritanism is 'an extremely convenient shorthand term', but one that 'is unavoidably a contextual, imprecise term, not an objective one, a term to use carefully but not take too seriously in itself'. Defining Puritanism has become a favourite parlour game for early modern historians. Some readers will be familiar with the discussion, but others may appreciate some basic orientation. The chapters in this collection offer different perspectives and approaches to the problem of definition, and together they build up a multifaceted picture of our subject. But we can begin by locating Puritans on the map of sixteenth and seventeenth-century European Christianity. © Cambridge University Press 2008.",2008,11/22/22 20:52,11/22/22 20:52,,1-16,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,ISBN: 9781139001960,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\PA59CEKG\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4FVRWKE7,journalArticle,Introduction,The Cambridge Companion to: Puritanism
"Lim, Paul",2021,"Lim, P.C.H.",,0591-2385,10.1111/zygo.12679,,"The last-half of seventeenth-century England witnessed an increasing number of works published questioning the traditional notions of God's work of creation and providence. Ascribing agency to matter, motion, chance, and fortune, thinkers ranging from Hobbes, Spinoza, modern-Epicureans, and other presented a challenge to the Anglican defenders of social and ecclesiastical order. By examining the genesis of the Boyle Lectures that began in 1692 with a bequest from Robert Boyle, we can see that while the Lecturers—three of whom will be examined in detail (Richard Bentley, John Harris, and William Whiston)—assiduously defended classical notions of the God–world relationship, they did so without a great sense of panic or pessimism. This transitional period in the mode of conflict or concord between religion and science sheds interesting lights on matters such as argument from design, biogenesis without purposive, personal agents, and scriptural exegesis and scientific inquiries. © 2021 by the Joint Publication Board of Zygon",2021,11/22/22 20:45,11/22/22 20:45,,143-167,,1,56,,,"ATHEISM, ATOMS, AND THE ACTIVITY OF GOD",,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\I2ESQUDZ\display.html,,,argument from design; exegesis of scripture; natural philosophy; prophecy; Richard Bentley; Robert Boyle; theology; William Whiston,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4BIL7F9H,journalArticle,"ATHEISM, ATOMS, AND THE ACTIVITY OF GOD: SCIENCE AND RELIGION IN EARLY BOYLE LECTURES, 1692–1707: with James C.

ITC envisioned itself as providing rigorous and relevant theological education that would enable Black churches and their communities to seize this new horizon. ITC would serve the age by preparing clergy to lead Black communities and their churches. As important as ITC’s history was in influencing my decision to enroll, so was my own family heritage. Long before the constituent schools came together, Gammon Theological Seminary, one of ITC’s parent institutions, had trained Black clergy for almost a century. So for ITC, the mission that began in 1958 did not end with the era of civil rights gains; it only adapted to the changing landscape of racialization. Indeed, ITC’s commitment to educate leaders extended to the entire Black church, and its many communities, not simply to those whom the church had historically privileged. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.",2016,11/22/22 20:55,11/22/22 20:55,,124-132,,,,,,A liberating spirituality,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,DOI: 10.4324/9781315648859,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\5XYDW9JL\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,96FEH4K9,bookSection,A liberating spirituality: Evaluating theological education at a black graduate school,Graduate Education at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs): A Student Perspective

Christian liturgical practices, which are grounded in a communicative economy of love and mercy, contain wisdom that might be of significant help. What difference might it make if we confessed sin (learned epistemic humility, worked at overcoming self-deception), interceded for others (learned to go beyond empathy to compassion and advocacy for the well-being of all persons, became willing to look beyond the possible for solutions, etc.), and learned from the best homiletical practices how to justify and apply moral positions within an ethic of hospitality and care? Speaking Together focuses on the roles that liturgical practices play in promoting genuinely communicative (understanding-oriented) forms of action and explores how liturgical practices contribute to sincere, multi-perspectival, empathetic, and truth-seeking conversations regarding moral norms in an increasingly pluralistic world. What this means is that our liturgical practices are a way of speaking together and this shapes how we organize and inhabit a shared social life.""-- Provided by publisher.",2018,6/11/20 18:56,8/18/20 20:44,,,,,,,,Speaking together and with God,,,,,Lexington Books,"Lanham, Maryland",eng,,,,,catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,Communication; Liturgics; Moral and ethical aspects,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,BE7SNQEQ,book,Speaking together and with God: liturgy and communicative ethics,

Liberation theologies tend to speak of human power in terms of the classical attributes of divinity: pure act, aseity, indivisibility, impassibility.  This leads to unsuspected ahistorical and politically ineffective views of power.  A critical reinterpretation of power can emerge from a concept of God, of the incarnation,  and of anthropology derived from the cross of Christ.  If the passion and death of Jesus are expressions of the being of God (and not just expressions of the saving activity of God),  this means a revolution in the concept of God and thus a revolution in the concept of power.",9/1/76,4/30/14 17:35,4/30/14 17:35,4/30/14 17:35,44-54,,2,33,,Journal of Religious Thought,,,,,,,,,,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\KAHK7MJS\Meeks - 1976 - God's suffering power and liberation.pdf,,,Peer reviewed; Liberation theology; Suffering of God,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,J3B3CNAH,journalArticle,God's suffering power and liberation,Journal of Religious Thought

Clearly structured, the volume is organized around a small number of 'core entries' which focus on key topics to provide a general overview of major subject areas, while making use of related shorter entries to impart a more detailed knowledge of technical terms. The work as a whole provides an introduction to the defining topics in Christian thought and is an essential reference point for students and scholars""--",2011,2/10/15 16:53,6/17/20 16:38,,225-226,,,,,,,,,,,Cambridge University Press,New York,eng,,,,,Primo,BV2.5 .C36 2011,,,,,,Theology Dictionaries,"McFarland, Ian A.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,WMDNRCD6,dictionaryEntry,Hope,The Cambridge dictionary of Christian theology

"Michelson, David A.",2019,"Michelson, David A.",,,,https://ir.vanderbilt.edu/handle/1803/16321,"This article examines the impact which Peter R.L Brown’s half century of scholarship has made on the historiography of Christianity. This article surveys five recurring motifs or theoretical approaches to Christianization which epitomize Brown’s interpretive method as an historian of Christianity: Christianization as social change, Christianization as continuity, Christianization as revolution, Christianization as simultaneously diverse and universal, and Christianization as unfamiliar. Individually, these themes challenge monolithic interpretations of “Christianization” in Late Antiquity. Taken as a whole, these themes reflect Brown’s emphasis on the paradoxical aspects of Christianity in Late Antiquity. As Brown himself has put it, his goal in constantly overturning scholarly assumptions about Christianization was to achieve “a sense of the salutary vertigo” in which the historian encounters ancient Christianity with “the same combination of wonder and respect that makes for fruitful travel in a foreign land.”",2019,7/27/21 22:40,6/30/22 18:45,7/27/21 22:40,45-70,,,,,,“Salutary Vertigo”,Études Byzantines et Post Byzantines,"new series, vol.

These manuscripts were catalogued in the nineteenth century shortly after a large collection of over 500 manuscripts were acquired by the British from the monastery of Dayr al-Suryān in Egypt. This article examines the intellectual assumptions that guided the nineteenth-century cataloguing efforts and offers a methodological proposal for how a new digital catalogue of the manuscripts could and should differ. New methods of digital representation can permit users to engage the Dayr al-Suryān manuscripts and the whole of the British Library Syriac collection from multiple, varied, and even conflicting perspectives. Several such digital approaches are being implemented in Syriaca.org’s digital catalogue of the British Library Syriac manuscripts. The diversity of such digital approaches promises to open new insights into the history of Christianity in late antiquity and beyond.",12/6/16,6/30/22 18:36,6/30/22 18:36,6/30/22 18:36,136-182,,1,5,,,Mixed Up by Time and Chance?,,,,,,,eng,,,,,brill-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu,,Publisher: Brill,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\WPG5M7LV\Michelson - 2016 - Mixed Up by Time and Chance Using Digital Methods.pdf,,,British Library; British Museum; Codicology; Digital Humanities; Diverse Knowledges; Graph Databases; History of Christianity; Linked Open Data; Manuscripts; Orientalism; Postcolonial Studies; Syriac; Syriaca.org; Traditional Cultural Expressions,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,L8WNAF8N,journalArticle,Mixed Up by Time and Chance?

The present article proposes a tentative data model for Syriaca.org's New Handbook of Syriac Literature, an open-access digital publication that will serve as both an authority file for Syriac works and a guide to accessing their manuscript representations, editions, and translations.

A decade of scholarship has accrued since its advent in religious studies with little notice among pastoral care specialists. Although several pastoral theologians have written about children generally, it has been almost twenty years since a scholar in the discipline has written a book on pastoral care and counseling of children that takes into consideration the intervening research. I chart some of the developments and characteristic features in the social sciences and theological studies that need to be kept in mind and argue that distinct advances have occurred, worthy of greater engagement by the pastoral counseling community, in both the recognition of children as active agents in families and other social institutions and the understanding of religion as shaped as much by routine practices as by verbal confession of belief claims.",2014,4/5/16 21:09,4/5/16 21:12,,,,,6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The e-Journal of the American Association of Pastoral Counselors,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PJ62XNTX,journalArticle,Childhood Studies and Pastoral Counseling,Sacred Spaces

Both interdisciplinary and international, the volume is brings together theologians and ethicists from Europe, the UK, Canada and the United States.

In this book Bonnie J. Miller-McLemore shows how this trend in scholarship has led to an expanded subject matter, alternative ways of knowing, and richer terms for analysis in doing Christian theology. Tracing more than two decades of her own search for a more inclusive discipline -- one that truly grapples with theology in the midst of life -- Christian Theology in Practice shows not only where Miller-McLemore herself has traveled in the field but also how pastoral and practical theology has developed during this time. Looking forward, Miller-McLemore calls on the academy and Christian congregations to disrupt conventional theological boundaries and to acknowledge the multiplicity of shapes and places in which the ""wisdom of God"" appears.",2012,10/14/14 2:04,8/25/20 15:41,,1-21,,,,,,,,,,,William B.

When complete, the twelve volumes of the series will cover all the Sundays in the three-year lectionary cycle, along with movable occasions, such as Christmas Day, Epiphany, Holy Week, and All Saints' Day.For each lectionary text, preachers will find four brief essays--one each on the theological, pastoral, exegetical, and homiletical challenges of the text. This gives preachers sixteen different approaches to the proclaimation of the Word on any given occasion.The editors and contributors to this series are world-class scholars, pastors, and writers representing a variety of denominations and traditions. And while the twelve volumes of the series will follow the pattern of the Revised Common Lectionary, each volume will contain an index of biblical passages so that nonlectionary preachers, as well as teachers and students, may make use of its contents.",1/27/09,1/5/15 20:28,7/10/18 19:10,,,,,,,,,,,,,Westminster John Knox Press,Louisville,English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/Feasting-Word-Pentecost-Season-Propers/dp/0664230989/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&qid=1420489325&sr=8-7&keywords=feasting+on+the+word+year+b,,,"Bartlett, David L.; Taylor, Barbara Brown",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1ST edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,E76M2UEQ,bookSection,"Pastoral Commentary on Psalms 29, 103, and 104 (Day of Pentecost, Trinity Sunday, Proper 3 in Year B)","Feasting on the Word: Year B, Vol. 3: Pentecost and Season after Pentecost 1"

"Morrill, Bruce T.",2012,"Morrill, Bruce T.",978-1-57075-993-2,,,,"This year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the beginning of Vatican II (1962-65), a watershed event in the history of the church whose meaning and interpretation continue to inspire heated debate. In this book fifty leading theologians, scholars, and pastoral leaders offer their own assessment of the meaning of the Council, in many cases drawing on their personal experience as witnesses or participants. The contributors are a who s- who of modern Catholic voices: Francis Murphy (who, as Xavier Rynne, penned an inside account of the Council for The New Yorker, Lisa Sowle Cahill, John O Malley, Joan Chittister, Gregory Baum, Michael Novak, Basil Pennington, Richard McBrien, Cardinal Avery Dulles, John Dominic Crossan, Joseph Komonchak, Brother Roger of TaizÃ©, Cardinal Francis Arinze, Elizabeth Johnson, David Hollenbach, and many more. Beginning with an overview of the Council in context, successive chapters cover the liturgy; the understanding of the church; revelation, scripture, and tradition; ecumenism and interreligious dialogue; world issues and social justice. Many of the stories provide behind-the-scenes details of what went on at the Council as well as what went on in the lives of those it affected. For those who want to understand what happened at the Council, as well as those concerned about the state of the church today and the agenda for the future, these fifty personal stories provide an invaluable, and inspiring resource.",7/25/12,10/30/14 15:34,10/30/14 15:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,Orbis Books,"Maryknoll, NY",English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/Vatican-II-Fifty-Personal-Stories/dp/1570759936,,,"Madges, William; Daley, Michael J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,KW79MVUN,bookSection,Change as the Norm,Vatican II: Fifty Personal Stories

Clooney has gathered nine American Jesuit scholars teaching at universities to reflect on their scholarly work, why they engage in it, and how the work they do coheres with their self-understanding as Jesuits. In accounts that weave together scholarly lives and personal stories, the contributors to this volume explore the irreducible diversity of their experiences and criticize the dominant modern synthesis that shaped Jesuit institutions of higher education from the 1960s to the 1990s. While the contrapuntal display of voices enunciated in this collection will unsettle the conventional and still dominant ways of talking about Jesuits, scholarship, and religious intellectual inquiry, Jesuit Postmodern does not end the conversation, but pushes scholars to talk more critically and imaginatively.",3/7/06,10/30/14 17:35,10/30/14 17:35,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lexington Books,"Lanham, MD",English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/Jesuit-Postmodern-Scholarship-Vocation-Identity/dp/073911400X,,,"Clooney, Francis X.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,CMANIH4F,bookSection,What Difference Does it Make for Me as a Liturgist to be a Jesuit--or Vice Versa?,"Jesuit Postmodern: Scholarship, Vocation, and Identity in the 21st Century"

"Morrill, Bruce T.",2020,Brice T. Morrill,,,,,"The Protestant Reformation emphasized the centrality of Scripture to Christian life; the twentieth-century liturgical movement emphasized the Bible's place at the heart of liturgy. But we have not yet explored the place of the Bible as the subject of critical exegesis in contemporary liturgy, argues Gordon W. Lathrop. He seeks to remedy that lack because it is critical historical scholarship that has shown us the grounding of the text in the life of the assembly and the role of intertextuality in its creation. ""Saving"" and revitalizing images of the past are at the heart of Scripture and are the work of the gathered community. Lathrop finds patterns in biblical narratives that suggest revising our models of the ""shape"" of liturgy (after Dix and Schmemann) and our understanding of baptism, preaching, Eucharist, and congregational prayer. He lifts up the visual imagery at the Dura Europos house church and elsewhere as a corrective to the supersessionist impulse in much Christian typology. He identifies the liturgical imperative as seriousness about the present rather than an effort to dwell in an imagined past. Saving Images is a call for a new, reconceived biblical-liturgical movement that takes seriously both biblical scholarship and the mystery at the heart of worship. -- Publisher Description.",2020,8/4/21 20:43,8/4/21 20:45,,178-180,,,94,,,Saving images,,,,,,,eng,,,,,catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,Book review,Bible; Liturgics; Liturgical use,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Lathrop, Gordon W.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,VA37PAU6,journalArticle,Book Review: Saving images: the presence of the Bible in Christian liturgy,Worship

"Morrill, Bruce T.",2017,"Morrill, B.T.",,0774-5524,10.2143/QL.98.1.3275141,,"This article revisits the work of Orthodox theologian Alexander Schmemann (1921-1983) to explore strengths and weaknesses in his arguments concerning a critical question for liturgical theology, namely, the relationship between sacraments and ethics, faith and (social) action, mysticism and politics, liturgy and life. Schmemann published a tight corpus of writings focused on articulating the irreducible, eschatological content of the liturgy as revelatory of divine redemption, while continuously insisting that this fundamental tradition of the church is doubly crippled by ignorance of its eschatological nature and mistaken efforts to draw contemporary social concerns into its practice. Thus, a thesis aligning the liturgical with the political provokes a reassessment of Schmemann's contribution to the field of liturgical theology. A review of some of Schmemann's more trenchant statements among his widely read textbooks opens into a broader interrogation of his publications - especially his posthumously published personal journals - so as to advance the question from the perspective of political theology. In the process, narrative proves a methodological link between the two types of theology, particularly through the contributions of Johann Baptist Metz and Edward Schille-beeckx. © 2017, all rights reserved.",2017,11/28/22 18:47,11/28/22 18:47,,41-59,,2-Jan,98,,,The liturgical is political,,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,Scopus,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\EBRM6EYC\display.html,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,VA2EAY52,journalArticle,The liturgical is political: A Narrative-Theological Assessment of Alexander Schmemann's Work,Questions Liturgiques

"Quigley, Jennifer",2018,"Quigley, Jennifer Aileen",,,,http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:40560141,"Abstract: This dissertation investigates how early Christ-followers used financial language to articulate and imagine their relationship to the divine. In the ancient Mediterranean, the divine was an active participant in what we call the economic sphere. Gods and goddesses were represented as owning goods, holding accounts, and producing wealth through the mediation of religious and civic officials. In this dissertation, I use a variety of epigraphic, papyrological, and literary evidence to examine the use of financial terms that are found throughout Paul’s letter to the Philippians, asking: what sorts of human-human and human-divine relationships are described? Paul describes his relationship with the Philippians using the business language of a koinonia, a shareholding venture, in the gospel. He uses language of deposit and security to represent his imprisonment as a contribution to the success of the gospel venture in which both he and the Philippians participate. In Philippians 3, he commodifies Christ and suffering. In Philippians 4, Paul refers to a divine accounting system to offer a promissory note to the Philippians for their support of him. I also explore Polycarp’s Letter to the Philippians, which exemplifies one trajectory in the afterlife of this theo-economic rhetoric. There the commodification of Christ and suffering has been turned towards polemical ends., My study adds a new framework of analysis, theo-economics, to New Testament and early Christian texts. This new framework allows a better understanding of major theological and economic logics in early Christianity, and the imbrication of themes such as poverty, labor, social status, cosmology, and eschatology. The framework of theo-economics also makes visible an emerging “economy of suffering” in early Christianity, which is present in the Letter to the Philippians and expands in multiple directions after Paul. Thus, my study has implications for New Testament and early Christian studies as well as Roman history, economics, and the study of religion.",2018,11/16/22 16:46,11/16/22 16:48,,,,,,,,Divine Accounting,,,,,Harvard University,,eng,,ThD,,,hollis.harvard.edu,,Book Title: Divine Accounting: Theo-Economics in the Letter to the Philippians HOLLIS number: 99153848676203941,,,http://id.lib.harvard.edu/alma/99153848676203941/catalog,,"Doctoral dissertations.; Religion, Biblical Studies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,ZWIXUZMD,thesis,Divine accounting: theo-economics in the letter to the Philippians,

Careful reading of texts, inscriptions, coins and other archaeological materials allow the reader to examine how religious practice in Philippi changed as the city moved from being a Hellenistic polis to a Roman colony to a center for Christian worship and pilgrimage. The essays raise questions about traditional understandings of material culture in Philippi, and come to conclusions that reflect more complicated and diverse views of the city and its inhabitants.

The authors, representing Wesleyan backgrounds in this volume, all hold concern for a suffering world, believing that socioeconomic systems, prescribed roles, stereotypes, or power differentials cannot dictate normative destinies for persons or for living systems. Each writer calls for movement from suffering to surviving to thriving in the midst of discussions about how alienation, in a variety of contexts, can be transformed into connection and reconnection through intentional shifts in circumstance and human agency. A hermeneutic of healing and justice focused on human relationship with the environment, economic and social systems that disconnect and reconnect, socio-cultural and economic constructs that divide or heal, encountered difference that brings opportunity, and various manifestations of personal pain that can turn to hope, provides a significant, realistic alternative to suffering and alienation. Meaningful connection to each other and to the earth through the alleviation of suffering provides hope for the integrity and future of humankind and the healing of the planet. This book is an offering to those who are called to work for change and a challenge to those who do not believe that change should or could happen. Alienation is not the final word. Connection and hope can prevail.",10/25/11,6/27/18 17:19,6/27/18 17:20,,,,,,,,,,,,,Lexington Books,"Lanham, Md",English,,,,,Amazon,,,,,https://www.amazon.com/Alienation-Connection-Suffering-Global-Age/dp/0739137050/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1530119926&sr=1-1&keywords=Alienation+and+Connection%3A+Suffering+in+A+Global+Age,,,"Withrow, Lisa R.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,LNS27SN3,bookSection,"Globalization, Empire, and Beyond: The Challenges of Globalizing Christianity and Religion",Alienation and Connection: Suffering in a Global Age

But we often meet globalization with extreme ambivalence, recognizing that it has both positive and negative consequences for economics, politics, and culture. Joerg Rieger makes the point that even theology itself can be a manifestation of globalization. At its worst, theology can reflect Western intellectual imperialism, and at its best, theology can encourage a compelling vision of diversity within unity. The author articulates a theology of globalization as a diverse phenomenon that respects different ways of seeing and knowing, thus encouraging harmony rather than homogeny."" """"Rieger's Globalization and Theology is an important contribution to contemporary theology. In this succinct volume, he provides a careful and sophisticated diachronic analysis of hard and soft power in relation to globalization and theology. His call for self-critical theological reflection, modeled throughout, challenges us to develop alternative models to globalization from above.""--Elaine A. Robinson, Academic Dean and Associate Professor of United Methodist Studies and Christian Theology, Saint Paul School of Theology at Oklahoma City University"" """"Joerg Rieger has provided a fresh and fascinating prospective on the relationship of globalization and theology. Globalization has long been understood as a domesticating influence, which blunts the voice of local particularities. However, in Globalization and Theology, Rieger insightfully demonstrates the vitality of the counterforces which globalization also unleashes which can empower distinctive new voices in theology. The complex web of connectedness, which globalization unleashes, is shown by Rieger to be a force and counterforce as old as Christianity itself.""-Timothy C.

As a result, economic crisis is an everyday reality that permanently affects all levels of our lives. The logic of downturn, developed in this book, helps make sense of what is going on, as the economy shapes us more deeply than we had ever realized, not only our finances and our work, but also our relationships, our thinking, and even our hopes and desires. Religion is one arena shaped by economics and thus part of the problem but, as Joerg Rieger shows, it might also hold one of the keys for providing alternatives, since it points to energies for transformation and justice.

In this new challenging modus, religion raises questions about identity, power, rationality, subjectivity, law and safety, but above all: religion questions, contests and even blurs the borders between the public and the private. These phenomena urge to rethink what are often considered to be clear differences between religions, between the public and the private and between the religious and the secular.

The few who currently use the term ""class"" think 'poor people, ' 'social stratification, ' or 'income differentials.' Commonly overlooked are power differentials, the tensions between classes, and the question of production. The essays in this volume discuss what new discourses on class in religious and theological studies might add to cutting-edge developments in these fields. Religion, Theology, and Class demonstrates that just like the lack of the study of class distorts the study of religion and theology, renewed engagement leads to new insights and broader horizons. The audience for this work includes students and scholars of religion and theology with various research interests, as well as students and scholars of other fields like economics, sociology, political studies, and cultural studies.

Both academic and non-academic philosophers are represented, as are a large number of female and minority thinkers whose work has been neglected. It includes those intellectuals involved in the development of psychology, pedagogy, sociology, anthropology, education, theology, political science, and several other fields, before these disciplines came to be considered distinct from philosophy in the late nineteenth century. Each entry contains a short biography of the writer, an exposition and analysis of his or her doctrines and ideas, a bibliography of writings, and suggestions for further reading. While all the major post-Civil War philosophers are present, the most valuable feature of this dictionary is its coverage of a huge range of less well-known writers, including hundreds of presently obscure thinkers. In many cases, The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers offers the first scholarly treatment of the life and work of these writers.",2005,6/27/18 20:10,9/21/20 18:03,6/27/18 20:10,,,,,,,,,,,,Thoemmes Continuum,,en_US,,,,,www.oxfordreference.com,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\AB43ARUP\acref-9780199754663.html,,,Philosophy,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,5TVZYXCW,dictionaryEntry,Frederick Herzog,The Dictionary of Modern American Philosophers

Power, like religion, is in collaboration. Along this line, this book affirms that one could see and study the power structures and power relations of a religion in and through the missions of empires. Empires rise and roam with the blessings and protections of religious power structures (e.g., scriptures, theologies, interpretations, traditions) that in return carry, propagate and justify imperial agendas. Thus, to understand the relation between religion and power requires one to also study the relation between religion and empires. Christianity is the religion that receives the most deliberation in this book, with some attention to power structures and power relations in Hinduism and Buddhism. The cross-cultural and inter-national contributors share the conviction that something within each religion resists and subverts its power structures and collaborations. The authors discern and interrogate the involvements of religion with empires past and present, political and ideological, economic and customary, systemic and local. The upshot is that the book troubles religious teachings and practices that sustain, as well as profit from, empires."" --",2019,8/18/21 18:16,8/18/21 18:17,,71-84,,,,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1079410249,,,,,,,,,,,"Havea, Jione; Cowan, Collin",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,R6VLRALU,bookSection,"Empire, Deep Solidarity, and the Future of Resistance",Religion and power

Consequently, major religious traditions form as they come into contact with other religions and cultures, typically in situations of struggle and pressure. Due to neoliberal capitalism, more people are on the move today than ever before. Most are driven by necessity (migration due to violence, poverty, and perceived poverty); others, by religious quests that are often fueled by experiences of tension (pilgrimage). The chapters in this volume explore the complexity of these situations, examining in detail how theology and religion shape up in various contexts ""on the move"" and investigating specific problems and tensions in order to suggest solutions, alternatives, and new possibilities.",2020,8/18/21 17:14,8/18/21 17:14,,,,,,,,Theologies on the move,,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1202998094,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,6LZEVSUD,book,"Theologies on the move: religion, migration, and pilgrimage in the world of neoliberal capital",

With this volume, an international group of scholars and activists from nine different countries is bringing issues of religion, class, and labor back into conversation. Historians and theologians investigate how new images of God and the world emerge, and what difference they can make. Biblical critics develop new takes on ancient texts that lead to the reversal of readings that had been seemingly stable, settled, and taken for granted. Activists and organizers identify neglected sources of power and energy returning in new force and point to transformations happening. Asking how labor and religion mutually shape each other and how the agency of working people operates in their lives, the contributors also employ intersectional approaches that engage race, gender, sexuality, and colonialism. This volume presents transdisciplinary, transtextual, transactional, transnational, and transgressive work in progress, much needed in our time.""--Back cover.",2020,8/18/21 17:13,8/18/21 17:13,,,,,,,,"Faith, class, and labor",,,,,,,English,,,,,Open WorldCat,,OCLC: 1228317431,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MMYV32DL,book,"Faith, class, and labor: intersectional approaches in a global context",

From the Introduction: “The heartbeat of this book is its concern to reimagine interreligious dialogue as a “dialogue of and for life” by interlinking it with liberation. What drives it is a passion that seeks to hold together two distinct concerns that emerged within theological thinking during the latter half of the 20th century and have since freed theological imagination in manifold ways.”",,6/28/22 20:39,6/28/22 20:42,6/28/22 20:39,,,,,,,,,,,,World Council of Churches,,en,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\6L2LNTRL\faiths-seeking-justice.html,,,,Peniel Jesudason Rufus Rajkumar,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,UKN5CQAA,bookSection,Interreligious Dialogue beyond Dialogue: Revisiting Truth and Power from a Christian Perspective under the Conditions of Empire,Faith(s) Seeking Justice World Council of Churches

He attributes this shift, and an accompanying deterioration of social well-being, to neoliberal capitalism’s villainization of the less fortunate and promotion of a “survival of the fittest” mentality. This introduction provides a preview of the ways in which neoliberalism has compromised the social fabric, leading to an erosion of community and growing economic inequality. Drawing from his allegiance to the working class and commitment to the care of souls tradition, Rogers-Vaughn calls for a post-capitalist revision of pastoral care and theology that emphasizes social and political conditions, rather than individual decisions and behaviors, as the root of human suffering.",2016,8/18/21 19:31,8/18/21 19:31,8/18/21 19:31,1-34,,,,,,Introduction,New Approaches to Religion and Power,,,,Palgrave Macmillan US,New York,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1057/978-1-137-55339-3_1,,,,,Pastoral Care; Census Tract; Child Poverty; Economic Inequality; Pastoral Theology,"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,M2ISEFGV,bookSection,Introduction: Preface to a Post-Capitalist Pastoral Theology,Caring for Souls in a Neoliberal Age

During this historical epoch, traditions about Israel and Judah's founding became fixed as markers of ethnic identity, and much of the canonical Hebrew Bible came into its present form.  Concentrating on these events, a clearer historical picture emerges. The entire volume is set within the context of Doug Knight's contributions, which have encouraged a rigorous social-scientific and tradition-historical approach to the Hebrew Bible and ancient Israel in general.  Many scholars have pursued how the social scientific method, first used to analyze early monarchic Israel, can shape the understanding of these later historical periods.  Knight's methods, teachings, writings, and scholarly interventions have pointed the contributors of this volume to fresh considerations of the Persian and Hellenistic periods.  The concluding essay will examine the future directions in which such sociological and historical investigation can go forward.",2012,12/11/14 20:57,5/1/15 14:40,,2-18,,,,,,,Library of Hebrew Bible Old Testament studies,,,,Bloomsbury T&T Clark,London,English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/dp/0567656284/ref=asc_df_05676562843445708?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&tag=pg-1583-86-20&linkCode=df0&creative=395097&creativeASIN=0567656284,,,"Berquist, Jon L.; Hunt, Alice",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reprint edition,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,G5PVBEZA,bookSection,Another look at the tenth commandment,Focusing Biblical Studies: The Crucial Nature of the Persian and Hellenistic Periods: Essays in Honor of Douglas A.

"Sasson, Jack",1989,"Sasson, Jack M.",978-1-85075-213-4,,,,"Well-known for his work in ancient Near Eastern languages and literature, Sasson emphasizes in this revised edition of his commentary on Ruth various philological matters: problems of translation, idiom and grammar, all with strong linguistic insights. The author also treats literary features, and provides admirably compact and accurate synopses of scholarly debates, while often charting his own course. For folkloristic interpretation, Sasson concentrates on formal aspects of the text to identify the genre of Ruth, and then systematically surveys narrative feature, provenance, date, and purpose of writing. There is a large bibliography, and indexes of biblical citations, authors and subjects are provided. For this second, corrected, edition, the author has written a new preface outlining developments in Ruth studies since 1979.",12/1/89,12/12/14 16:09,12/12/14 16:10,,,292,,,,,,,,,,Sheffield Academic Press,"Sheffield, England",English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/Ruth-Biblical-Seminar-Jack-Sasson/dp/1850752133,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,4X847HZQ,book,Ruth: A New Translation.

"Sasson, Jack",2011,"Sasson, Jack M.",978-1-907534-33-1,,,,"This volume honours the distinctive contribution to Hebrew Bible studies over four decades by Cheryl Exum, Professor Emerita of Biblical Studies in the University of Sheffield. Her special interests have lain, first, in the modern literary criticism of the Hebrew Bible, where her key work was Tragedy and Biblical Narrative: Arrows of the Almighty. Asecond area has been feminist criticism of the Hebrew Bible; here her notable contributions were Fragmented Women: Feminist (Sub)versions of Biblical Narratives and Plotted, Shot, and Painted: Cultural Representations of Biblical Women. A more recent, and now almost favourite, theme is the Bible and cultural studies, especially the Bible and art. Key works here have been a series of edited volumes, such as Beyond the Biblical Horizon: The Bible and the Arts, and The Bible in Film / The Bible and Film. Her fourth area of continuing interest has been the Song of Songs, with many articles culminating in her perceptive commentary in the Old Testament Library series. In this rich volume, 25 of her friends and colleagues offer her papers on all these themes. Several are on or around the Song of Songs (Graeme Auld, Fiona Black, David Clines, Sara Japhet, Martti Nissinen, Yair Zakovitch), and topics of feminist interest (Yairah Amit, Athalya Brenner, Claudia Camp, Hugh Pyper, Jack Sasson). Cultural studies are represented by Alice Bach, Hans Barstad, Andrew Davies, David Gunn, Martin O'Kane, John Sawyer and Ellen van Wolde, and literary criticism by Michael Fox, Edwin Good, Norman Gottwald, Edward Greenstein, Francis Landy, Burke Long and Hugh Williamson.",2011-11,12/11/14 21:12,12/11/14 21:14,,333-355,,,,,,,,,,,Sheffield Phoenix Press Ltd,"Sheffield, England",Inglese,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.it/Critical-Engagement-Essays-Hebrew-Honour/dp/1907534334,,,"Clines, David J.

Among the first to bring a focus of scholarly attention to the period of ancient Israel's creativity after the Exile, she has also been a leader in foregrounding the Jewish tradition within the interpretative discourse of biblical scholars. And as a woman scholar, she has advanced the study of issues in the Hebrew Bible that impinge on the concerns of women ancient and modern. Tamara Eskenazi was awarded the 2008 National Jewish Book Award for her volume The Torah: A Women's Commentary and the 2011 National Jewish Book Award in Women's Studies for her commentary on Ruth in the Jewish Publication Society Bible Commentary series. The 26 articles offered to Tamara Eskenazi by her friends in this volume represent the range of her interests in all things biblical and Jewish. From Genesis to the New Testament to modern Hebrew fiction, from technical studies on the prophets or Qumran to penetrating insights on her beloved philosopher Levinas, this volume beautifully represents the range and depth of Jewish culture.

"Segovia, Fernando F.",2018,"Segovia, Fernando F",,,,https://ourarchive.otago.ac.nz/handle/10523/8558,"A key principle in the work of Latin American liberation theologians has been a willingness to take their Latin American social context seriously as an aid for understanding biblical texts. This paper is intended to illustrate the value of this principle by focussing on some disturbing points in the gospel accounts of crucifixion in the light of recent accounts of torture and terror in Latin America. It argues that documentation of torture and abuse in Latin American military regimes can illuminate neglected aspects of Jesus’ passion presented in the gospels. Most importantly this involves recognition that crucifixion was a form of torture that served a wider purpose than execution and was used to demonstrate the state’s power and terrorise those who might oppose it. Within this framework, one issue in the horror of Jesus torture and crucifixion which has been completely neglected in Christian tradition—the degree of sexual abuse that it involved—can be addressed honestly and openly. My central contention is that crucifixion in the ancient world carried a strongly sexual element and should be understood as a form of sexual abuse. The gospels indicate that Jesus was subjected to a high degree of sexual humiliation and was possibly a victim of sexual assault. The final part of this paper suggests the constructive purposes that the acknowledgement of this sexual abuse might serve.",2018,8/25/21 19:43,8/25/21 19:45,8/25/21 19:43,,,,,,,"Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse",,,,,"Centre for Theology and Public Issues, University of Otago",,en,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/,,,,ourarchive.otago.ac.nz,,Accepted: 2018-11-08T19:41:43Z,,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\DEU449E9\Tombs - 2018 - Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse Text .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\3LSRUH76\8558.html",,,,,,,,,"Tombs, David John",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2SN73SZT,bookSection,Jesus as Victim of State Terror: A Critical Reflection Twenty Years Later,"Crucifixion, State Terror, and Sexual Abuse: Text and Context"

Each volume of the New Interpreter's Bible includes two complete translations of selected books of the Bible, commentary, and reflections. The New Interpreter's Bible incorporates several other key strengths: the exegetical commentary and the theological reflections for each biblical book are written by one individual, ensuring consistency of perspective; the ecumenical roster of contributors includes top scholars and emerging new voices; the biblical text is divided into coherent and manageable units, such as pericopes, which allows discussion of important issues that are overlooked in a verse-by-verse treatment. - Jacket.

Each volume of the New Interpreter's Bible includes two complete translations of selected books of the Bible, commentary, and reflections. The New Interpreter's Bible incorporates several other key strengths: the exegetical commentary and the theological reflections for each biblical book are written by one individual, ensuring consistency of perspective; the ecumenical roster of contributors includes top scholars and emerging new voices; the biblical text is divided into coherent and manageable units, such as pericopes, which allows discussion of important issues that are overlooked in a verse-by-verse treatment. - Jacket.

This is the first book to gather the available ancient Near Eastern, extra-biblical sources containing prophetic words or references to prophetic activities. Among the 140 texts included in this volume are oracles of prophets, personal letters, formal inscriptions, and administrative documents from ancient Mesopotamia and Levant from the second and first millennia B.C.E. Most of the texts come from Mari and Assyria. In addition, the volume provides new translations of the relevant section of the Egyptian Report of Wenamon, by Robert K. Ritner, and of various texts from Syria-Palestine containing allusions to prophets and prophetic activities, by C.L. Seow. By collecting and presenting evidence of the activities of prophets and the phenomenon of prophecy from all over the ancient Near East, the volume illumines the cultural background of biblical prophecy and its parallels. It provides scholars of the history, religions, and cultural traditions of the ancient Near East with important information about different types and forms of transmissions of divine words, and makes these valuable primary source materials accessible to students and general readers in contemporary English along with transcriptions of the original languages, indexes, and extensive bibliography.",2003,10/10/14 19:35,11/15/22 20:34,,,273,,,,,,Writings from the ancient world,12,,,Society of Biblical Literature,"Atlanta, GA",English,,,,,OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch,,,,,,,Histoire.

These include the ordination of homosexuals and the blessing of homosexual unions, as well as broader issues dealing with liturgical and theological language about God and the role of the church in a pluralistic society. The contributors speak of these various issues as theological educators, ministers, and committed Christians. They ask, What do the scriptures say about homosexuality and related issues? How should the scriptures inform our theological reflection? and How do we live faithfully in regard to this matter? And like the Christian community at large, the contributors are not of one mind on any of these issues; many times they are in considerable disagreement. Homosexuality and Christian Community will help to guide churches and individuals engaged in theological reflection about the place of homosexuals in the church.",1996,10/10/14 19:35,10/10/14 19:45,,,159,,,,,,,,,,Westminster John Knox Press,"Louisville, Ky.",English,,,,,OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch,,,,,,,Religious aspects; Christianity; Biblical teaching.

In medieval times, spiritual direction was common in the Roman Catholic monastic traditions. It extended significantly into Protestant Christianity in the late twentieth century by predominantly white and affluent organizations. Spiritual direction has progressively become a global, multi-religious and interfaith practice. This book is a comprehensive and concise text from a spiritual director of color, offering inclusive resources and tools to spiritual directors of many faiths and for people of diverse cultures and traditions. Core skills such a deep listening, hospitality, and discernment are presented with cutting-edge lessons on internal liberation, systemic trauma, and imaginative discovery. Spiritual direction is taught by more than 100 educational institutions and spirituality centers in the US alone, but typical curriculum generally does not reflect current cultural reality and growing diversity.

This was, of course, a fantasy psychoanalyst—and certainly not a useful fantasy. I suspect that for most patients, regardless of their analyst, the first glance exchanged, if not already the first phone call, is filled with me-ness—and her response to me. New patients typically express some surprise that I am a black psychoanalyst. Discovering the meanings associated with this convergence of black and psychoanalyst takes—well, it takes what only time can offer—a relationship. Yes, I am a black psychoanalyst. I am also a black woman; and a “full-bodied” black woman; and a lesbian; and a womanist; and a practical theologian. The late black feminist lesbian poet Pat Parker thought that it would be revolutionary: If I could take all my parts with me when I go somewhere, and not have to say to one of them, ‘No, you stay home tonight, you won’t be welcome,’ because I’m going to an all-white party where I can be gay, but not Black. Or I’m going to a Black poetry reading, and half the poets are anti-homosexual or thousands of situations where something of what I am cannot come with me. The day all the different parts of me can come along, we would have what I would call a revolution.1",2011,8/31/21 16:37,8/31/21 16:37,8/31/21 16:37,81-110,,,,,,Black Psychoanalysis and Black Feminist Psychoanalytic Literary Criticism,Black Religion / Womanist Thought / Social Justice,,,,Palgrave Macmillan US,New York,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1057/9780230118027_5,,,,,Black Woman; Black Church; Black Experience; Psychoanalytic Theory; Racial Content,"Sheppard, Phillis Isabella",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7ZEDK5IC,bookSection,Black Psychoanalysis and Black Feminist Psychoanalytic Literary Criticism: Resources toward a Critical Appropriation of Psychoanalysis,"Self, Culture, and Others in Womanist Practical Theology"

The Center for Religion and Psychotherapy of Chicago, where I trained, offered a program specializing in the work of Heinz Kohut and the theory he developed, known as self psychology. I was struck by and drawn to what many thought of as Kohut’s radical and necessary shift from Freud’s classical drive model postulating that humanity is primarily motivated by innate sexual and aggressive instincts. Kohut stressed innate developmental needs that we turn to others to meet. The shift from drives leading our way into relationship to needs ultimately produced a view of the person where self-ness emerged out of the experience of satisfaction of crucial needs throughout life. We immediately see that Kohut recognized the importance of early developmental environment, the related needs, and advocated the lifelong need for others—as opposed to a developmental trajectory always toward a radical independence. The aspect of his work that I have found most compelling is where he links culture and self-experience. We will expand these ideas later in the chapter, but I think the following vignette can help us see why a psychoanalytic view of the relationship between culture and self is crucial.",2011,8/31/21 16:36,8/31/21 16:36,8/31/21 16:36,111-125,,,,,,Black Women and Self Psychology,Black Religion / Womanist Thought / Social Justice,,,,Palgrave Macmillan US,New York,en,,,,,Springer Link,,DOI: 10.1057/9780230118027_6,,,,,African American Woman; Black Woman; Religious Experience; Psychoanalytic Theory; Selfobject Experience,"Sheppard, Phillis Isabella",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,XKGDGCSK,bookSection,Black Women and Self Psychology: Toward a Usable Dialogue,"Self, Culture, and Others in Womanist Practical Theology"

Reflections by Nancy McWilliams,David Wallin, and Salman Akhtar are responded to by scholars representing a substantial range of psychological, spiritual, religious, and theological perspectives. The ensuing scholarly, clinical dialogue advances the idea that a psychotherapist’s formative spiritual experiences and core values both deeply influence and are simultaneously influenced by the therapeutic relationships and healing work that constitute his or her clinical practice. Through this addressing of the interplay between these master clinicians’ inner wisdom and the therapeutic process, readers will see demonstrated firsthand the vital importance of the psychotherapist’s spiritual life for creative and effective clinical work. This volume will also provide the opportunity for both experienced and training psychotherapists to enrich their own clinical practice via a more robust engagement in the points of contact and resonance that exist between their work with clients and their own unique spiritual lives and experiences.",9/24/14,10/30/14 19:13,11/18/14 22:33,,,,,,,,,,,,,Rowman & Littlefield Publishers,Lanham,English,,,,,Amazon.com,,,,,http://www.amazon.com/The-Skillful-Soul-Psychotherapist-Spirituality/dp/1442234482,,,"Stavros, George S.; Sandage, Steven J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,S7QCTG6D,bookSection,"Religion--It's Complicated!

The contributors think through different religious traditions to understand and address inequality. They make practical proposals in relation to concrete situations like mass incarceration and sweatshops. They also explore the inner experience of life in a society marked by inequality, tracing the contours of stress, hopelessness and a restless lack of contentment. This book honors the work of Jon P.
