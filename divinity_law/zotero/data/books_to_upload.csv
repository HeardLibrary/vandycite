These include the ordination of homosexuals and the blessing of homosexual unions, as well as broader issues dealing with liturgical and theological language about God and the role of the church in a pluralistic society. The contributors speak of these various issues as theological educators, ministers, and committed Christians. They ask, What do the scriptures say about homosexuality and related issues? How should the scriptures inform our theological reflection? and How do we live faithfully in regard to this matter? And like the Christian community at large, the contributors are not of one mind on any of these issues; many times they are in considerable disagreement. Homosexuality and Christian Community will help to guide churches and individuals engaged in theological reflection about the place of homosexuals in the church.",1996,10/10/14 19:35,10/10/14 19:45,,,159,,,,,,,,,,Westminster John Knox Press,"Louisville, Ky.",English,,,,,OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch,,,,,,,Religious aspects; Christianity; Biblical teaching.

This is the first book to gather the available ancient Near Eastern, extra-biblical sources containing prophetic words or references to prophetic activities. Among the 140 texts included in this volume are oracles of prophets, personal letters, formal inscriptions, and administrative documents from ancient Mesopotamia and Levant from the second and first millennia B.C.E. Most of the texts come from Mari and Assyria. In addition, the volume provides new translations of the relevant section of the Egyptian Report of Wenamon, by Robert K. Ritner, and of various texts from Syria-Palestine containing allusions to prophets and prophetic activities, by C.L. Seow. By collecting and presenting evidence of the activities of prophets and the phenomenon of prophecy from all over the ancient Near East, the volume illumines the cultural background of biblical prophecy and its parallels. It provides scholars of the history, religions, and cultural traditions of the ancient Near East with important information about different types and forms of transmissions of divine words, and makes these valuable primary source materials accessible to students and general readers in contemporary English along with transcriptions of the original languages, indexes, and extensive bibliography.",2003,10/10/14 19:35,11/15/22 20:34,,,273,,,,,,Writings from the ancient world,12,,,Society of Biblical Literature,"Atlanta, GA",English,,,,,OCLC WorldCat FirstSearch,,,,,,,Histoire.

Life in first-century Palestine was very different from our world today, and many traditional interpretations of Jesus' stories ignore this disparity and have often allowed anti-Semitism and misogyny to color their perspectives.In Short Stories by Jesus, Amy-Jill Levine analyzes these ""problems with parables"" taking readers back in time to understand how their original Jewish audience understood them. With this revitalized understanding, she interprets these moving stories for the contemporary reader, showing how the parables are not just about Jesus, but are also about us—and when read rightly, still challenge and provoke us two thousand years later.The Leader Guide contains everything needed to guide a group through the six-week study including session plans, activities, and discussion questions, as well as multiple format options.",5/15/18,6/11/20 18:53,6/11/20 18:53,,,66,,,,,Short Stories by Jesus Leader Guide,,,,,Abingdon Press,,English,,,,,Amazon,,Amazon was the only way to get a complete citation to Zotero,,,https://www.amazon.com/Short-Stories-Jesus-Leader-Guide-ebook/dp/B074KM3G83,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,Short Stories by Jesus Leader Guide: The Enigmatic Parables of a Controversial Rabbi,

Where, then, are Americans finding meaning in their lives, if not in the context of traditional religion? In this provocative study, the authors argue that the objects of our attention have become our god and fulfilling our desires has become our religion. They examine the religious dimensions of six specific aspects of American culture - body and sex, big business, entertainment, politics, sports, and science and technology - that function as ""altars"" where Americans gather to worship and produce meaning for their lives. The Altars Where We Worship shows how these secular altars provide resources for understanding the self, others, and the world itself. ""For better or worse,"" the authors write, ""we are faced with the reality that human experiences before these altars contain religious characteristics in common with experiences before more traditional altars."" Readers will come away with a clearer understanding of what religion is after exploring the thoroughly religious aspects of popular culture in the United States. - from publisher., $$Cbibliography_note$$VIncludes bibliographical references and index.",2016,2/13/18 19:00,2/13/18 19:00,,,,,,,,The altars where we worship,,,,,Westminster John Knox Press,"Louisville, Kentucky",eng,,,,,discoverlibrary.vanderbilt.edu,BR115 .C8 F563 2016,,,,,,United States; Christianity and culture United States; Christianity and culture; nne United States Popular culture; Popular culture; Popular culture Religious aspects Christianity; Popular culture United States,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,First edition.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,book,The altars where we worship: the religious significance of popular culture,
