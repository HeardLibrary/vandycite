"This book offers an examination of the polemical debates about the doctrine of the Trinity in seventeenth-century England, showing that this philosophical and theological re-configuration significantly impacted the politics of religion in the early modern period. Through analysis of these heated polemics, the book shows how Trinitarian God-Talk became untenable in many ecclesiastical and philosophical circles, which led to the emergence of Unitarianism. It also demonstrates that those who continued to embrace Trinitarian doctrine articulated their piety and theological perspectives in an increasingly secularized culture of discourse. Drawing on both unexplored manuscripts and well-known treatises of Continental and English provenance, the book unearths the complex layers of the polemic: from biblical exegesis to reception history of patristic authorities, from popular religious radicalism during the Civil War to Puritan spirituality, from Continental Socinians to English Anti-Trinitarians who avowed their relative independent theological identity, from the notion of the Platonic captivity of primitive Christianity to that of Plato as ""Moses Atticus."" Among this book's surprising conclusions are the findings that Anti-Trinitarian sentiment arose from a Puritan ambience, in which Biblical literalism overcame rationalistic presuppositions, and that theology and philosophy were not as unconnected during this period as previously thought.

"Four major ways in which Johannine scholars have attempted to solve the literary difficulties occasioned by the present position of John 15-17 in the Gospel are delineated.  The redactional approach is adopted, and John 15:1-17 is designated as an originally independent discourse.  The exegetical analysis of the passage shows the presence of an interrelated christological-ethical problem (docetic christology/libertine behavior) within the Christian community and thus thrusts these verses directly into the Sitz im Leben of 1 John.  Thus, the passage is said to be a later addition to the Gospel coming from the stage of 1 John.",5/21/14 19:45,,,,,,,"Segovia, Fernando F.",Peer reviewed; Bible. John --Theology; Bible.

"In the present sequence of the Fourth Gospel narrative, Jesus' farewell discourse to his disciples is quite extensive, encompassing as it does all of 13:31-17:26. However, the clearly concluding statements of 14:30-31c, the command of 14:31d to arise and depart, and the obvious connection of these verses with the beginning of the passion narrative (18:1-12) appear to divide this farewell into at least two seemingly independent and separate discourses.... In this present study, the author leaves all questions concerning chaps 15-17 aside and turns exclusively to the first discourse of 13:31-14:31.  Given its more limited scope, one would expect a greater degree of scholarly consensus concerning such issues as the structure, the Tendenz, and the Sitz im Leben of 13:31-14:31 than with chaps 15-17.  However, a review of the exegetical literature shows a great deal of disagreement with respect to these questions.   Such a situation is most unfortunate, because widespread agreement does exist with respect to the importance of this unit for and within the Fourth Gospel.

"Against the skepticism of some scholars, this essay argues that Psalm 1 is not only poetry but exquisite poetry. The aesthetic excellence consists not of balanced structure, predictable rhythmic patterns, or intricate design. Rather, it is on account of its brilliant imagerial contrast, its clever employment of both symmetry and asymmetry, its shrewd play with lineation, its subtle use of ambiguity and polyvalence, and its performative closure that this poem deserves to be considered among the finest in the Psalter and indeed the Bible. Furthermore, the essay shows how interpreters through the centuries are indispensable conversation partners for the modern interpreter. They broaden the horizon of every interpreter, and their voices contribute to a deeper appreciation of Psalm 1 as a theologically profound introduction to the Psalter, thereby inviting the reader to live a commendable life amid uncertainties, but a life that leads nevertheless to the praise of God.",10/21/14 21:45,,,,,,,"Seow, C.

"For more than forty years, the Workgroup on Constructive Theology has brought the liberal and liberationist theological traditions into creative encounter with lived human experience. In this introduction to the methods and tasks of theology, they invite a new generation of readers, many who will have little or no exposure to Christian doctrine, to see theology as a partner in the struggle for a better world. They demonstrate how theological ideas have ""legs,"" playing themselves out not only in religious communities but in the public square as well. Theology, the authors tell us, is constructive when it joins in God's work of building human lives and human societies. Readers will learn to think about all of life in light of their religious commitments and to see theology as an essential tool for a life well lived. - book blurb.",,,,,,,,"Schneider, Laurel C.; Ray, Stephen G.; Workgroup on Constructive Theology; Rieger, Joerg",Theology,,,,,,,,,,"Rieger, Joerg",,,,,,2016,9/30/20 19:23,9/30/20 19:24,"Rieger, Joerg",First edition.,,,,,,,978-0-664-26188-7,,,,,,eng,,,catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,,,,"Louisville, Kentucky",,,,2016,Westminster John Knox Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Awake to the moment,,,,,,,,Q108765614,DVEDULBV,book,Awake to the moment: an introduction to theology,

"Church giving is an understudied phenomenon; queries on Black Church giving are even rarer. In response to the latter dynamic, levels of tithing, income, and mission donations are examined based on a national sample of 1,601 Black churches across seven denominations using linear and ordered logit modeling. Findings show minimal ideological and programmatic effects. However, denominational differences suggest that Black congregations affiliated with the Church of God in Christ have higher relative percentages of tithers and those associated with the Presbyterian and United Methodist faiths have the lowest rates as compared with their Baptist peers. Moreover, African Methodist Episcopal Zion, Presbyterian, and United Methodist churches are more likely to have higher church incomes and mission giving than Baptists. Thus, although Baptists tend to generally have higher rates of church tithers, this pattern does not translate to higher church incomes or mission donations. As expected, church size and formally educated memberships positively influence giving patterns. Results provide important insights into the Black Church economic ethic.

Empires are marked by their efforts to control all of life, not only politics and economics, but also society, culture, and religion. Since their inception, liberation theologies have addressed this oppressive global situation by focusing on its various manifestations in terms of race, ethnicity, nationality, gender, sexuality, and class.

The article focuses on the Christian perspective on wealth in a world of economic inequality. It mentions that Christians who follow the gospel of prosperity teachings are rarely troubled by economic inequality because they see poverty as an outcome of lack of faith and economic success as a result of faithfulness to God.

"Friedrich Schleiermacher's work appears in new perspective when examined in the context of his little-known studies of far-away countries such as Australia and its inhabitants as well as the ""colonial phantasies"" of his time. His views of the Jewish religion and its practitioners can also be reassessed in this light. As the connections between the flows of power and ideas are examined, a deeper understanding of Schleiermacher's theology emerges both in terms of its limitations and its potential. This deeper understanding also throws new light on more overarching matters in Schleiermacher research, such as the character of his philosophical method and his hermeneutic.

"Abstract: Although capitalist free market economics is in crisis, its assumptions continue to shape not only how we do business or politics but also how we think and feel, and even what we believe. For theologians and scholars of religion this means that we can no longer do our work without taking into consideration what is happening in the economy and how it affects us; before religion can become part of the solution we need to understand how it has become part of the problem.

It affects life everywhere, as-using the language of the Occupy Wall Street movement-economic injustice pits the 99 percent against the 1 percent even in the United States.

", abstract:, While politics and religion are not to be discussed in polite company, as the saying goes, the topics of labor and class may well be more troublesome yet. In this article, reflections on labor, class, and justice help deepen ongoing interreligious dialogues between engaged Buddhism and liberation Christianity that began with the work of Paul Knitter and others. Although neither the topic of labor nor the topic of class is commonly studied in theology or religion, our investigation reveals deeper affinities with Christian and Buddhist traditions, broadening the conversation to include voices not often discussed in the West like that of B.R. Ambedkar, the prominent convert from Hinduism to Buddhism and father of the Indian constitution. Moreover, the topics of labor and class invite new engagements with the notion of justice, which is contested in the religious and cultural traditions of the West as well as in many Buddhist discourses, which tend to question its usefulness altogether. In the process of engaging not only the topics of labor and class as abstract categories but also related movementsâin particular the labor movement and other global social movementsânew possibilities for religious discourse and interreligious dialogue emerge that broaden contemporary understandings of religion. This leads to rethinking concepts such as reconciliation, nonviolence, solidarity, and social action in various contexts around the globe and in their usages in Christian and Buddhist traditions.",8/18/21 18:04,,,,,,,"Rieger, Joerg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1353/bcs.2019.0011,2019,8/18/21 18:04,8/18/21 18:04,"Rieger, Joerg",,,Publisher: University of Hawai'i Press,,,,,,1527-9472,,1,,,,,,Project MUSE,,,,,,,,,133-146,,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Religion, Labor, Class, and Justice",,,,https://muse.jhu.edu/article/735301,,39,,Q109408068,RCW2HVCF,journalArticle,"Religion, Labor, Class, and Justice: BuddhistâChristian Dialogue in Fresh Perspective",Buddhist-Christian Studies

"Christian theologians who study capitalism with a critical lens have argued that capitalist economics is not just a matter of finance or politics but tends to shape people all the way to the core, including religious beliefs and practices. Different theological approaches not only differ in how they conceive of the relation of religion and capitalism, they also differ in their evaluations of capitalism itself. While some Christian theologians endorse capitalism, others offer critical reflections and propose alternative economic systems, rooted in Christian traditions and practices as well as in broad historical and cultural shifts. Challenges include questions about the neoliberal turn in economics, the role of corporations, economic deregulation, competition and community, the reality of scarcity, the development of financial capitalism, as well as the relation of religion and labor, and the location of agency.",8/18/21 17:36,,,,,,,"Rieger, Joerg",corporations; economic democracy; financial capitalism; market and religion; money and religion; neoliberal capitalism; religion and labor,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/rec3.12350,2020,8/18/21 17:36,8/18/21 17:36,"Rieger, Joerg",,,_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/rec3.12350,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\II3TIYBB\rec3.html,,,,,1749-8171,,5,,,en,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,12350,,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/rec3.12350,,14,,Q109408076,2LH3AHZG,journalArticle,Capitalism and Christian theology,Religion Compass

"The hope of Abraham was &ldquo;hope against hope,&rdquo; the apostle Paul notes in a famous passage in his letter to the Romans 4:18. Such is the hope of the underdog, whose hope is not backed up by the powers that be, manifest by the prevalent empires of the day. Any discussion of hope in this context needs to deal with the limits of hope that have been expressed powerfully by Miguel De La Torre in his book Embracing Hopelessness (2017). As a result, the faith of Abraham that led to hope against hope cannot be blind faith, or what has sometimes been called &ldquo;the power of positive thinking.&rdquo; COVID-19 has once again reinforced this insight. Only when the challenges and the roadblocks to faith and hope are seen and embraced, and when false hope is exposed for what it is, can glimpses of real hope break through.",8/18/21 17:33,,,,,,,"Rieger, Joerg",alternative power; economic downturn; false hope; hopelessness; religion and liberation; religion and neoliberal economics,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.3390/rel11070331,2020-07,8/18/21 17:33,8/18/21 17:33,"Rieger, Joerg",,,Number: 7 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\YB7EYCQA\Rieger - 2020 - Hoping against Hope Dealing with Hopelessness in .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\C2BACC6U\htm.html,,,,,,,7,,,en,,,www.mdpi.com,,,,,,,,,331,,,,,2020,,,,,,http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,,,,,,,,,,,Hoping against Hope,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/11/7/331,,11,,Q109408079,M9L84MAG,journalArticle,Hoping against Hope: Dealing with Hopelessness in Ancient Times and Today â ,Religions

"Three traits inform a pastoral theological hermeneutic. These include: interpreting âthe living human webâ; relying upon the unique location and nature of pastoral theological imagination; and embodying the power that comes with knowledge and the discernment of meaning. These traits often lead to pastoral theologians seeing things in a different light than colleagues in other theological disciplines, while often holding comparatively less power or influence in the academy.

"The relationship between losses within mainline Protestant churches and the resistance to women in ministry is explored. Loss in congregations and denominations awakens an unconscious desire for a âdominant otherâ that will save the church from real or perceived loss or even the threat of death. Women are not seen as âdominantâ and are thus overlooked when leadership for restoration is sought. Loss may also awaken unconscious resentment and hatred against women. Women are associated with the âwombishnessâ of Jesus, a trait historically rejected, but one that could not be destroyed even as it remained life-giving and nurturing.",6/12/14 19:27,,,,,,,"Hamman, Jaco J.",Women; Ministry; Sociology; Jesus; Dominant other; Loss; Marcus Borg; Silvano Arieti; Clinical Psychology; Cross Cultural Psychology; Religious Studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11089-010-0299-2,12/1/10,6/12/14 19:27,6/12/14 19:27,"Hamman, Jaco",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\37HK5F7Q\Hamman - 2010 - Resistance to Women in Ministry and the Psychodyna.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\2IATWKXE\s11089-010-0299-2.html,,,,,"0031-2789, 1573-6679",,6,,Pastoral Psychol,en,,,link.springer.com,,,,,,,,,769-781,,,,,2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11089-010-0299-2,,59,,Q109408522,N7VRTK35,journalArticle,Resistance to Women in Ministry and the Psychodynamics of Sadness,Pastoral Psychology
"Jesus calls on his followers to forgive, lest they risk the denial of Divine forgiveness. Such forgiveness should not be confused with human forgiving. Human forgiveness is identified as a pastoral-theological âproblem,â especially in the context of intimate violence. A working definition of forgiveness is provided and the nature of this âproblemâ is explored. Reader-response criticism is identified as a way to read Jesus on forgiveness.

"The experience of getting away with something is a well-known personal dynamic, yet it is relatively unexplored by psychodynamic theorists, even though such experiences impact both persons and society in significant ways. In reading the Gospels, one is left with the perception that Jesus got away with desireâthat is, he withstood Satanâs temptations.

"This essay explores how happiness is maintained as a memory of the first relationship and when that memory is disturbed, envy can set in. Envy is the angry feeling that another person possesses and enjoys something desirableâthe envious impulse being to take it away or to spoil it. The thought of Melanie Klein and her 1957 work, Envy and Gratitude, guides the inquiry. Happiness in one person can offend when another experiences the happiness as goodness of life that is being withheld from them. Since all persons carry the memory of happiness, seeing the happiness of others reminds us of something once owned or experienced, but now lost. Envy becomes a defense against the painful memory of happiness once known. The biblical figure King Saul is identified as someone who experienced envy in the face of a young Davidâs happiness. Envy not only robs a person of happiness, it removes a sense of gratitude.",12/16/14 20:29,,,,,,,"Hamman, Jaco J.","Envy; Clinical Psychology; Cross Cultural Psychology; Religious Studies; Sociology, general; David; Gratitude; Happiness; Melanie Klein; Saul",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11089-013-0555-3,8/29/13,12/16/14 20:29,7/7/21 19:03,"Hamman, Jaco",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\MUUTEPVN\Hamman - 2013 - The Memory of Feeling Envy and Happiness.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\HBGXEXM9\s11089-013-0555-3.html,,,,,"0031-2789, 1573-6679",,4,,Pastoral Psychol,en,,,link.springer.com,,,,,,,,,437-352,,,,,2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Memory of Feeling,,,,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11089-013-0555-3,,64,,Q109408526,7BIS84AS,journalArticle,The Memory of Feeling: Envy and Happiness,Pastoral Psychology

"This article explores the interplay of fantasy and image in male solitary masturbation in the virtual age. Online pornography has drastically changed the intimate relationship between the hand and the penis. The case of a 17-year-old boy and his excessive use of Internet pornography is used to highlight pornographyâs impact on a personâs well-being and neurology. A brief exploration of three histories of masturbation shows how the discourse on masturbation often serves political agendas and addresses the central role of sexual fantasy in the practice. Sexual fantasy is explored through the research of British psychoanalyst Brett Kahr. To examine the significance of the eye in pornography, philosopher Michael Taussigâs concept of âthe eye as the organ of tactilityâ is discussed. The essay concludes by offering a framework for discerning whether masturbating to images might be disordered or not. Fantasy, which is nonvisual sexual arousal, can relieve a person from the tyranny of the eye and of compulsive masturbation.",1/11/18 22:30,,,,,,,"Hamman, Jaco J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11089-017-0797-6,12/4/17,1/11/18 22:30,1/11/18 22:30,"Hamman, Jaco",,,,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\LBGM4XP3\Hamman - 2017 - The Organ of Tactility Fantasy, Image, and Male M.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\WNFB3Y4R\10.html",,,,,"0031-2789, 1573-6679",,,,Pastoral Psychol,en,,,link.springer.com,,,,,,,,,1-27,,,,,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Organ of Tactility,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11089-017-0797-6,,,,Q109408530,62LJMALS,journalArticle,"The Organ of Tactility: Fantasy, Image, and Male Masturbation",Pastoral Psychology
"This article traces developments in the 25-year history of a metaphor that has shaped the late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century discipline of pastoral theology in the United States. It looks back at the âliving human documentâ as a pivotal image and then identifies three trends behind the appearance of the âliving human web,â its key attributes, four divergent ways the metaphor has been used, and tasks ahead. The article argues that while the living human document addressed the challenge of irrelevant theology, the living human web responded to the challenge of social injustice. But both metaphors share a common aim endemic to the disciplineâto expand empathy, whether for the individual or the wider context, in order to respond to people in need.",5/13/20 20:16,,,,,,,"Miller-McLemore, Bonnie J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11089-018-0811-7,6/1/18,6/11/20 18:56,6/11/20 18:56,"Miller-McLemore, Bonnie",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\4QFKZQ74\Miller-McLemore - 2018 - The Living Human Web A Twenty-five Year Retrospec.pdf,,,,,1573-6679,,3,,Pastoral Psychol,en,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,305-321,,,,,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Living Human Web,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11089-018-0811-7,,67,,Q109408531,HASLLS9E,journalArticle,The Living Human Web: A Twenty-five Year Retrospective,Pastoral Psychology
"During the chaos surrounding the first two years of the Trump presidency in the United States, what may be missed is the extent to which Trump is a marker of financial capitalism, with its compulsive dependency on the production of debt. In this essay, the author does not assess Trump personally but rather what he signifies with regard to financialization. He begins by documenting the phenomenal increase in household and total global debt that began during the onset of neoliberalization, as Trump was beginning his business enterprises. This debt has created a global economic and moral emergency. Second, the author discusses the central role of debt in financial capitalism and in the neoliberal ideology, or faith narrative, that justifies the debt system. Debt has become so foundational that it is transforming not only the economy but also culture, relationships, and subjectivity. This yields a new form of moral injury that is becoming pervasive. In the third move, he considers debt as a social, interpersonal, and psychological conundrum. Many mainline progressives are insistent that debt can be reformed and thus serve societies, communities, and individuals in beneficent ways. The author contends that the proposed reforms would likely spell the end of capitalism, an outcome these theorists generally wish to avoid. Furthermore, he points to evidence from psychoanalytic psychotherapy indicating that even relational, nonmonetized forms of indebtedness may prove to be interpersonally and psychologically damaging. Relational obligations, he notes, do not have to follow the logic of debt. Finally, the author contests Christian theological narratives that understand sin and salvation in terms of debt and debt forgiveness, and he points to an alternative approach within the history of Christian theology that holds promise given the current environment of toxic and insufferable debt.",5/12/20 19:30,,,,,,,"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11089-018-0847-8,10/1/19,6/11/20 19:01,6/11/20 19:01,"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",,,,,,,,,1573-6679,,5,,Pastoral Psychol,en,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,511-532,,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,âIâm the King of Debtâ,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11089-018-0847-8,,68,,Q109408533,SHC9SV7A,journalArticle,âIâm the King of Debtâ: Pastoral Reflections on Debt in the Age of Trump,Pastoral Psychology
"Using D. W. Winnicottâs object relations theory in conversation with Lewis R. Ramboâs scholarship on conversion, this paper explores the transformation of the biblical figure of Job. The first part of the paper explores the origins and meaning of the âpsychodynamics of conversionâ and highlights the paradoxical nature of conversion. Ramboâs stage theory is discussed. Wolfgang Iserâs reader-response theory is identified as inviting an object relations perspective on Job. Drawing on Winnicott, the paper then describes Jobâs experience of loss, transformation, and confessionâa process of conversionâand compares it to Ramboâs stages of conversion.",7/7/21 19:46,,,,,,,"Hamman, Jaco J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11089-020-00910-9,8/1/20,7/7/21 19:46,7/7/21 19:46,"Hamman, Jaco",,,,,,,,,1573-6679,,4,,Pastoral Psychol,en,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,361-382,,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The Psychodynamics of Conversion,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11089-020-00910-9,,69,,Q109408534,2MVJUA58,journalArticle,The Psychodynamics of Conversion: Winnicottian Perspectives on the Transformation of Job,Pastoral Psychology
"The essay draws on the psychodynamic theory of D.W. Winnicott to argue for eight interrelated reasons informing the playing of men. Through playing, men seek to reestablish a holding environment; (re) discover their bodies; dabble with non-pathological insanity or madness; support their true self; experience transformation and enter transitional spaces; toy with destruction; seek healing from physical, emotional, relational, and spiritual wounds; they play to experience ego orgasms; and, men play for playâs own sake. The authorâs own playing, in the form of long-distance motorcycling provides a backdrop of lived experience for the essay. The article mirrors Winnicottâs methodology, which resisted grand theory making as it focuses on specific psychodynamic insights and themes. Winnicottâs thought is used to extend William Blakeâs wisdom around toys and reasons, wisdom Erik Erikson explored previously.",7/7/21 19:44,,,,,,,"Hamman, Jaco J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11089-021-00937-6,2/1/21,7/7/21 19:44,7/7/21 19:44,"Hamman, Jaco",,,,,,,,,1573-6679,,1,,Pastoral Psychol,en,,,Springer Link,,,,,,,,,87-106,,,,,2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Toys,,,,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11089-021-00937-6,,70,,Q109408535,7ASIVCC9,journalArticle,Toys: a Man Has His Reasons.

"The continued debate about whether the Black Church has lost its activist voice is rooted in the historic resistance versus accommodation dialectic. The former stance positions the Black Church for involvement in electoral and protest politics; the latter stymies these processes. This project examines the contemporary Black Church's political presence on several social media sites. Findings document its continued political involvement thematically associated with calls for social justice and moral action, electoral and protest politics, redress for social problems, and a linked fate mentality and collective memory. Moreover, results illustrate how electoral and protest politics, based on a historic Black Church cultural toolkit, can reflect both a social issue to be championed and a strategic process used to promote other agendas. A resistance versus accommodation dialectical model provides a cogent explanation for the political pluralism and ambiguity such congregations can exhibit as well as for many Black Christians to prioritize issues of racial justice and economic empowerment above more conservative religious views they may espouse.",7/18/14 18:57,,,,,,,"Barnes, Sandra L.; Oluchi Nwosu","Social media; Politics; Sociology, general; black church; Political Science, general; Regional and Cultural Studies",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12111-013-9263-4,2014,7/18/14 18:57,6/16/21 19:20,"Barnes, Sandra L.",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\VWXVKZJX\Barnes and Nwosu - 2014 - Black Church Electoral and Protest Politics from 2.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\IKF6RR9T\10.html,,,,,"1559-1646, 1936-4741",,2,,J Afr Am St,en,,,link.springer.com,,,,,,,,,209-235,,,,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Black Church Electoral and Protest Politics from 2002 to 2012,,,,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12111-013-9263-4,,18,,Q109408540,5QX72EUI,journalArticle,Black Church Electoral and Protest Politics from 2002 to 2012: a Social Media Analysis of the Resistance Versus Accommodation Dialectic,Journal of African American Studies
"The Black Church has a long history of sponsoring youth educational programs. Yet Black students continue to lag behind their White counterparts in academic outcomes. This research note examines; (1) sponsorship of tutoring or literacy programs based on a national sample of 1,863 Black churches across seven denominations and (2) the forms of congregational cultural capital that influence such efforts. Results show denominational differences. Moreover, larger churches as well as those with formally educated leaders and members are more likely to sponsor tutorial or literacy programs. Churches that provide religious and religious-education programs, include gospel rap music during worship, and strive to increase membersâ awareness of racial, social, and political issues are also more likely to sponsor these programs. Lastly, although the influence of spiritual dictates varies, churches that more frequently expose members to sermons about personal spiritual growth are also more apt to offer these youth educational programs. Best practices are provided to identify and harness the various forms of church capital found in Black congregations to improve educational outcomes for Black students.",7/24/14 22:28,,,,,,,"Barnes, Sandra L.","Education; Religious Studies; Sociology, general; black church; Anthropology; Literacy programs; Psychology, general; Tutoring; Youth",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s13644-014-0173-2,2015,7/24/14 22:28,6/16/21 19:45,"Barnes, Sandra L.",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\D7V47QC6\10.html,,,,,"0034-673X, 2211-4866",,1,,Rev Relig Res,en,,,link.springer.com,,,,,,,,,111-129,,,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"To Educate, Equip, and Empower",,,,http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13644-014-0173-2,,57,,Q109408541,4QHEUD3F,journalArticle,"To Educate, Equip, and Empower: Black Church Sponsorship of Tutoring or Literary Programs",Review of Religious Research

"For those whose vocation calls them to respond to policies and practices that marginalize those already on the edges, these are challenging days and even frightening days. As a womanist and practical theologian, my vocation demands that I listen not just to the horror stories that I hear from my students, colleagues, or the texts we read (or from within) but it also demands I listen for the ways that the past and present converge to expose a way forward. This push toward the way forward is an ethical demand to act on the teaching that all humanity is created good and welcome.

"Pedagogical space is a theo-ethical-pastoral process where one notices and probes the reality of what is being wrought in the world. Theo-ethical-pastoral space requires the learning community to discern what we contribute to the state of affairs and ascertain our obligations to move from discernment and analysis to activism for justice. In other words, this space is formational and has a telos in mind. Because it is formational space, our understanding of pedagogical practices has to go beyond analytical capacities of theo-ethical pastoral reflection; the process must entail formational strategies and methodological action.",5/12/20 19:07,,,,,,,"Sheppard, Phillis Isabella",pedagogy; Womanist; culture; methodology; psychology; social justice,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/10649867.2018.1452691,9/2/17,6/11/20 19:02,6/11/20 19:02,"Sheppard, Phillis",,,Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/10649867.2018.1452691,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\W4GZTQNR\Sheppard - 2017 - Hegemonic Imagination, Historical Ethos, and Colon.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\YEQCBCT4\10649867.2018.html",,,,,1064-9867,,3,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,,,,,,181-194,,,,,2017,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hegemonic Imagination, Historical Ethos, and Colonized Minds in the Pedagogical Space",,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/10649867.2018.1452691,,27,,Q109417469,EDKEUHCU,journalArticle,"Hegemonic Imagination, Historical Ethos, and Colonized Minds in the Pedagogical Space: Pastoral Ethics and Teaching as if our Lives Depended on it",Journal of Pastoral Theology

"The relocation experiences of refugees can be daunting; refugee children must contend with a unique set of challenges. Drawing on Berryâs (1976, 2005, 2009) concept of acculturation that emphasizes integration and multiculturalism rather than assimilation, this ethnography examines the educational practices at Shaw Academy, a charter school for immigrant, refugee, and native-born children. We focus on the schoolâs involvement in positive ethnic identity development for refugee students, strategies to combat injustices, and self-efficacy promotion. Findings suggest that multicultural teaching, curricula, and programmes, spearheaded by ethnically diverse personnel, promote academic adjustment for refugee students by fostering appreciation for cultural diversity, positive ethnic identity development, and agency.

"Historian of religion Charles H. Long's landmark text, Significations: Signs, Symbols, and Images in the Interpretation of Religion (1986), has served as a lynchpin for the interdisciplinary study of black religion and culture since its original publication more than a quarter of a century ago. This article focuses on how Long's masterwork has stimulated innovative theories and methods utilised in analysing the origins and varieties of black religious experience in the wake of New World slavery that often have been subsumed under the heavy-laden concept of âBlack religion.â Additionally, this article contextualises the influential nature of Long's work upon the history of black religions in the modern world as modalities of both orientation and meaning-making by emphasising the book's powerful descriptions and critical analyses of black religious phenomenology. Through a historiography of New World slavery, religion, and culture within the context of the Black Atlantic, this article identifies a cluster of major theoretical paradigms illustrated by recent, far-ranging studies of race, religion, and culture at the height of the African enslavement in the circum-Atlantic world.",2/13/18 19:04,,,,,,,"Floyd-thomas, Juan M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/1467-9809.12409,12/1/16,2/13/18 19:04,6/23/21 20:00,"Floyd-Thomas, Juan Marcial",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\TIUFXUWB\Floyd-thomas - 2016 - Towards a Religious History of the Black Atlantic.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\UHTITQX5\abstract.html,,,,,1467-9809,,1,,Journal of Religious History,en,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,3-24,,,,,2016,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Towards a Religious History of the Black Atlantic,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9809.12409/abstract,,42,,Q109417530,44ENAZZP,journalArticle,Towards a Religious History of the Black Atlantic: Charles H.

We describe a transformative experience in an interdisciplinary course on families that we team taught.

"Since the early 1990s, the number of children with imprisoned mothers has increased 131%. A mother's imprisonment potentially exposes children to a concentrated disadvantage that undermines their cognitive, emotional, and intellectual abilities. Additionally, such experiences can have deleterious effects on mother-child relationships, stand-in caregivers, foster care caseloads, the penal system, and society. Less may be understood, however, about how imprisonment affects the ways in which women view themselves as mothers. This study examines mothering attitudes for a sample of 210 Black, White, and Hispanic imprisoned mothers. Nested modeling results suggest a positive relationship between favorable views about mothering and children's profiles and mothers' expectations about future custody. Regular contact with their children through letter writing and telephone calls foster the most favorable views.",7/18/14 19:54,,,,,,,"Barnes, Sandra L.; Stringer, Ebonie Cunningham",identity theory; imprisoned mothers; mothering role,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/j.1741-3729.2011.00696.x,2012-04,7/18/14 19:54,7/17/18 17:23,"Barnes, Sandra L.",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\AGKR27SD\Stringer and Barnes - 2012 - Mothering While Imprisoned The Effects of Family .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\CRCK8N2T\abstract.html,,,,,1741-3729,,2,,,en,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,313-326,,,,,2012,,,,,,Â© 2012 by the National Council on Family Relations,,,,,,,,,,,Mothering While Imprisoned,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-3729.2011.00696.x/abstract,,61,,Q109417541,K6MTIUT4,journalArticle,Mothering While Imprisoned: The Effects of Family and Child Dynamics on Mothering Attitudes,Family Relations
"Religious organizations regularly perform key bridge building and political activation tasks in the racialized landscape of living wage organizing in the U.S. As bridge builders, they mediate the varied concerns and cultures of labor, immigrant, and black civil rights organizations through ideology translation, relational repair, and inclusion monitoring. Religious organizations' social location and indigenous leadership development also cultivates levels of political participation among poor people and people of darker colors that often outstrip their economic and educational demographics.

"Several commentaries on the book of Job have appeared since the publication of 4QJoba in 2000. Yet none has taken its readings into consideration in the exegesis of the passages represented therein. It is the purpose of this study, therefore, to reexamine the variants in 4QJoba, assess their value for the textual criticism and exegesis of the book, and consider the relationship of the ms to the mt and other Vrss. This article contends that 4QJoba does not strictly belong to the text tradition represented by the mt and that in several cases it preserves readings that are at least viable if not even superior to what one finds in the mt, including at 31:15; 36:23, 24; 37:1, and 37:2.",2/5/16 22:44,,,,,,,"Seow, C.

"AbstractThis article re-examines criticism-of-religion in Marxâs âA Contribution to the Critique of Hegelâs Philosophy of Right. Introductionâ and its role in his development of historical materialist criticism in the wake of Derridaâs attempted revaluation of the identification of religion with ideology in Marxâs later writings. It first focuses upon Marxâs appropriation and use of Feuerbachâs criticism of religion in âContributionâ and the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts. Then it situates âContributionâ âs famous apothegm, religion âis the opium of the people,â in relation to Marxâs subsequent writings on the âCelestial Empireâ China and in the context of opiumâs multiple contemporary significations. Marxâs understandings of religion and its critique are thus seen to well exceed the assumed limitation of the latterâs purview to ideology criticism and the conventional characterizations of the former as false consciousness, ineffectual protest, and/or depoliticizing consolation. Marxâs criticism-of-religion is shown to exemplify what he calls âirreligious criticism.â",6/27/14 19:41,,,,,,,"Geller, Jay",China; criticism-of-religion; Jacques-Derrida; Karl-Marx; Ludwig-Feuerbach; opium-of-the-people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1163/15700682-12341263,2/5/14,6/27/14 19:41,7/22/20 20:59,"Geller, Jay",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\59DQ2C59\Geller - 2014 - Table Dancing in an Opium Den Marxâs Conjuration .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\49U723KB\15700682-12341263.html,,,,,1570-0682,,1,,,,,,booksandjournals.brillonline.com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,,,3-21,,,,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Table Dancing in an Opium Den,,,,http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/content/journals/10.1163/15700682-12341263,,26,,Q109417560,M5DAIX66,journalArticle,Table Dancing in an Opium Den: Marxâs Conjuration of Criticism out of âCriticism of Religionâ in 1844,Method and Theory in the Study of Religion

"The texts in the Hebrew Bible dealing with old age and the elderly should be understood in light of multiple contexts-the socioeconomic settings of real life in ancient Israel; the material indications that life expectancy must have hovered around age 40, which was probably considered elderly and suffering the ailments of old age; and the literature from surrounding cultures that depicts the afflictions of old age.

"The so-called âSuffering Servantâ of Isaiah 52:15â53:12 takes on new meaning in each of his settings, from the exilic or early post-exilic community of Deutero-Isaiah, to the repurposing of this figure by the author of Daniel, mid-second century BCE during the persecutions of Jews by Antiochus IV Epiphanes, through the numerous New Testament citations of and allusions to Jesus as fulfilling Isaiahâs predictions concerning this servant, and on to several post-biblical Jewish understandings of this enigmatic figure. In showing how and why the servant receives such numerous readings, we demonstrate both how readers across the centuries and within different traditions understand Isaiah through their own circumstances, and why Jews and Christians should respect each otherâs readings rather than attempt to âproveâ the truth of one tradition on the basis of a specific understanding of prophecy.",4/18/20 0:38,,,,,,,"Brettler, Marc; Levine, Amy-Jill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/0020964318820594,4/1/19,6/11/20 18:53,6/11/20 18:53,"Levine, Amy-Jill",,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd,,,,,,0020-9643,,2,,Interpretation,en,,,SAGE Journals,,,,,,,,,158-173,,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Isaiahâs Suffering Servant,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020964318820594,,73,,Q109417589,9Q7YE99Q,journalArticle,Isaiahâs Suffering Servant: Before and After Christianity,Interpretation

"This article explores the making of Black women's radical subjectivity in Black women's writings. Black women's radical subjectivity shatters the boundaries of geopolitical spaces traditionally defined through citizenship while creating alternative social imaginaries that represent a space where home and belongingness may be attained and self-determination realized. It is from the examination of Black women's textualities that one can detect an upheaval of nation-state racial formations that subverts the policing power of the state to force and essentialize racial identities. In this article, the authors trace the process of subverting forced identities, violent acts, and the narrativity of race. The authors analyze the lives, the movements, and the actions of the Black female protagonists from three geopolitical contexts as portrayed in the following novels: African American author Alice Walker's ""The Color Purple,"" Caribbean author Michelle Cliff's ""No Telephone to Heaven,"" and South African author Lauretta Ngcobo's ""And They Didn't Die"".",5/13/14 19:46,,,,,,,"Floyd-Thomas, Stacey M.; Gillman, Laura",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/002193470203200503,5/1/02,5/13/14 19:46,6/30/21 15:50,"Floyd-Thomas, Stacey",,,,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\UV2PJAIS\Floyd-Thomas and Gillman - 2002 - Subverting Forced Identities, Violent Acts, and th.pdf",,,,,,,5,,Journal of Black Studies,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,528-556,,,,,2002,,,,,,"Copyright Â© 2002 Sage Publications, Inc.",,,,,,,,,,,"Subverting Forced Identities, Violent Acts, and the Narrativity of Race",,,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/3180951,,32,,Q109417604,IXP8E27U,journalArticle,"Subverting Forced Identities, Violent Acts, and the Narrativity of Race: A Diasporic Analysis of Black Women's Radical Subjectivity in Three Novel Acts",Journal of Black Studies

"The exercise of memory, both within and in relation to the performance of sacramental rites, comprises a number of related phenomena rich in theological and anthropological complexity. Due to their symbolic and ritual natures, memory and liturgy each evade abstract, generalizing theories while nonetheless inviting historical, social-scientific, and theological analyses useful to pastoral ministry. Given the importance yet complexity of the role of memory in liturgy, the author proposes a typological approach, essaying a number of models of liturgical memory according to some dozen categories, while noting that the mystical and political dimensions of these overlap and mutually impact each other in the practices of actual assemblies.",8/4/21 20:33,,,,,,,"Morrill, Bruce T.",Bible; affectivity; Anamnesis; church; liturgy; memory; ritual; time; tradition; typology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/0039320719884125,3/1/20,8/4/21 20:33,8/4/21 20:33,"Morrill, Bruce T.",,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\H96WEN7X\Morrill - 2020 - Models of Liturgical Memory Mystical-Political Di.pdf,,,,,0039-3207,,1,,Studia Liturgica,en,,,SAGE Journals,,,,,,,,,40-54,,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Models of Liturgical Memory,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/0039320719884125,,50,,Q109417618,7EKPIFMQ,journalArticle,"Models of Liturgical Memory: Mystical-Political Dimensions, Mythic-Historic Tensions",Studia Liturgica

"Despite documentation of intergroup conflict between African Americans and Irish immigrants during the mid-nineteenth to mid-twentieth centuries, few studies have comparatively considered the beneficence of religion as an adaptive, conciliatory mechanism for the two ethnic groups. Yet, literature supports the historic centrality of the Black Church for the former group and the indelible influence of Catholicism for the latter. This research examines common religious themes and organized efforts associated with these faith traditions for the two historically oppressed groups. Informed by Cultural Theory, this study compares and contrasts religious cultural dynamics to illumine adaptive features and activism. Exilic themes based on nationality, race, and/or ethnicity tied to biblical symbolism; social programs and self-help; as well as appropriation of Liberation Theology are common group patterns. Yet, findings also illustrate the inability of religion to foster substantial intergroup cooperation in light of other prevailing systemic forces.",1/5/15 22:28,,,,,,,"Barnes, Sandra L.",Religion; African American; immigrant; Irish,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/0160597614560567,2014,1/5/15 22:28,6/16/21 19:33,"Barnes, Sandra L.",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\98EHC58N\0160597614560567.html,,,,,"0160-5976,",,3,,Humanity & Society,en,,,has.sagepub.com,,,,,,,,,294-320,,,,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://has.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/12/05/0160597614560567,,39,,Q109417659,ID2WJWKT,journalArticle,Exiles in a Foreign Land A Comparative Analysis of the Historical Role of Religion for African Americans and Irish Immigrants,Humanity & Society

"The Hebrew historiographer has left a theological narrative recalling many moments in which God would abandon his people only to offer them repeated opportunities for renewals: after Paradise, after the Flood; with Abraham, Joseph, Moses, etc.  Modern biblical scholars single out one of these moments at which to initiate their reconstructions of Hebraic history.  When facing the dearth of extra-biblical evidence which directly and incontrovertibly authenticates the historicity of the biblical traditions, modern historiographers search their own pasts for models that give coherence and plausibility to the reconstruction they undertake.  This paper details three schemes, the German ""Rise of the nation-state,"" the American ""Social clashes"" and ""Nation of immigrants"" that are used as models by which to rebuild biblical history.",12/12/14 4:35,,,,,,,"Sasson, Jack M.","Peer reviewed; Sociology, Biblical; Israelites, Ancient; Historiography",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/030908928100602101,10/1/81,12/12/14 4:35,8/25/21 15:04,"Sasson, Jack",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\3D4FQ3VU\Sasson - 1981 - On choosing models for recreating Israelite pre-mo.pdf,,,,,0309-0892,,21,,Journal for the Study of the Old Testament,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,3-24,,,,,1981,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rfh&AN=ATLA0000787746&site=ehost-live,,,,Q109417663,36NEWNBW,journalArticle,On choosing models for recreating Israelite pre-monarchic history,Journal for the Study of the Old Testament

"In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: Laura Gillman Laura Gillman is Associate Professor of Women's Studies and Spanish at Virginia Tech University. Her intellectual and political interests and commitments include the racial and transnational dimension of feminist theory and politics; the intersections of race, class, gender, and post-colonial studies within the African diaspora and transnational Latina contexts; and feminist and anti-racist education and pedagogy within the U.S. academy. Stacey M. Floyd-Thomas Stacey M. Floyd-Thomas is a Social/Christian/Womanist ethicist and scholar. She is an assistant professor of Religious Studies, Women's Studies, and Black Studies in the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies at Virginia Tech University in Blacksburg, Virginia. In her scholarly research she examines the effects that the normative institutions of church, education, family, and nation-state formation have on defining marginalized groups and such institutions' undertaken tasks to subvert normative standards in order to define their own identities. Notes 1. AnzaldÃºa (1987) uses the term new mestiza consciousness to distinguish her model from the Chicano nationalist mestizo identity. She uses this term to confront the tradition of male dominance within her community. The new mestiza consciousness, which we also refer to as mestizaje, has as its primary purpose to validate Chicana selfhood. Her goals in this endeavor are twofold: (1) to break down the dualities that subordinate Chicanas in order to abandon contradictory notions of selfhood and embrace one's differences in a newly realized whole self. Her articulation of Chicana lesbian theory, for example, breaks down the dichotomy between male and female attributes through a reoriented conceptualization of sexuality and (2) to claim the indÃ­gena part of Chicana identity as an appeal to resist essentialized notions of identity in order to critique her culture's denial of the indigenous part of Chicana culture and history. AnzaldÃºa thus redefines Chicano cultural nationalism through gender and sexuality, paving the way for the consciousness of a fully racialized feminist Chicana. ChÃ©la Sandoval draws on AnzaldÃºa's theoretical model of mestiza consciousness in order to create a method for Chicana empowerment. 2. For more on the relationship between women of color's literary tradition and its relation to history, see Katie Cannon (1988). 3. When we say re-member, we mean one thing: to reunite what has been separated when the border crossed over Mexico to form a New Mexico/Nuevo Mexico, by culturally acknowledging that unity through a way of being, a consciousness that the Chicana, the new mestiza, brings to this process. This re-membering fits squarely within recent trends among Chicano scholars who have begun to develop notions of ""trans-creation,"" a term to describe the process of a new cultural formation among Mexican and American Latino cultures. This process is deemed innovative and creative, developed from a history of living in cultural ambiguity. As cultural historian George J. Sanchez (1993) observes, Mexicans continue this custom in the United States as they live in the cultural-in-between, or borderlands. This is not a social imaginary but rather a reality of these people wherein the intent is to give this conscienticized process legitimacy as a geopolitical and cultural process. 4. Various theorists, as noted by Sandoval, have provided alternative terms for the differential mode, namely womanist, mestiza, third force, and hybrid. 5. In ""The Countryless Woman"" (1995), Castillo underscores their shared colonization, their shared entry into the transnational labor force into which Mexic-Amerindian women are born, and which was created out of Mexico's neo-colonialist relationship to the United States. Mexicans and MexicanAmericans alike have served a labor force controlled by U.S. policy. Mexico encourages the emigration of this labor force to alleviate its own depressed economy and the United States consumes this labor force without giving back to it the benefits enjoyed by U.S. residents. 6. For further elaboration of mujerista theology, see Isasi-Diaz's En la lucha/In the Struggle. 7. The maternal is a central theme in this novel. Although we do not have the time or space to develop the topic here, the reworking of the myth of Guadalupe as the mythic reincarnation of the ""good"" mother is one of the most intriguing aspects...",5/13/14 19:57,,,,,,,"Floyd-Thomas, Stacey M.; Laura Gillman",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1215/15366936-2.1.158,2001,5/13/14 19:57,6/30/21 15:42,"Floyd-Thomas, Stacey",,,"<p>Volume 2, Number 1, 2001</p>",C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\K6IRRJ2A\Gillman and Floyd-Thomas - 2001 - Con un pie a cada ladoWith a Foot in Each Place .pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\529M8HPN\2.1.gillman.html,,,,,1547-8424,,1,,,,,,Project MUSE,,,,,,,,,158-175,,,,,2001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Con un pie a cada lado/With a Foot in Each Place,,,,http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/meridians/v002/2.1.gillman.html,,2,,Q109417673,RIGN2GWJ,journalArticle,Con un pie a cada lado/With a Foot in Each Place: Mestizaje as Transnational Feminisms in Ana Castillo's So Far from God,"Meridians: feminism, race, transnationalism"

"The deficit in Western Christian theology of trinitarian thought in relation to economic problems, such as work and property,  is a cause of the North American church's increasing accommodation to the prevailing economic assumptions.  The prevalent God-concepts in the mainline churches have a strict analogy to the organizing concepts of the ""spirit of capitalism"".  A trinitarian doctrine of the Holy Spirit calls into question the deepest assumption of Western economics (including socialist), namely, the assumption of scarcity.  A biblical perspective on economics begins with the assumption that,  if the righteousness of God through the Holy Spirit is present, there is more than enough for all of God's creatures to live abundantly.",,,,,,,,"Meeks, M Douglas",Holy Spirit; God--Activity,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.14315/evth-1980-0105,1/1/80,4/30/14 17:33,7/27/21 18:28,"Meeks, M.

"This article examines whether and how sacramental liturgy and the Christian life-ethic are intrinsically related, a fundamental problematic in theory and practice in the decades since Vatican Council II. The first half of the essay examines the state of the question, starting with a brief articulation of the normative tradition based in scripture and the councilâs Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, followed by a selective review of the theological discussion, centered on Don E. Saliersâs virtue-ethics approach. The second half, building on a thesis of Johann Baptist Metz, argues for poverty of spirit as the key virtue for practically bonding liturgy and ethics.",8/4/21 20:30,,,,,,,"Morrill, Bruce T.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.14712/23363398.2020.45,9/15/20,8/4/21 20:30,8/4/21 20:31,"Morrill, Bruce T.",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\UVAXUEWD\Morrill - 2020 - Pursuing the Intrinsic Relationship between Liturg.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\Z8QZBMFJ\article-8266.html,,,,,,,1,,,en,,,karolinum.cz,,,,,,,,,77-98,,,,,2020,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Pursuing the Intrinsic Relationship between Liturgy and Ethics,,,,https://karolinum.cz/en/journal/auc-theologica/year-10/issue-1/article-8266,,10,,Q109417960,4BIDPHVH,journalArticle,Pursuing the Intrinsic Relationship between Liturgy and Ethics: Practical-Theological Promise in Poverty of Spirit,AUC THEOLOGICA

"SUMMARY The brief coda devoted to the Trinity in Schleiermacher's The Christian Faith does not intend to marginalize the doctrine. It indicates that the doctrine, though at present still to be completed, is the recapitulation of the entire scheme of redemption. The central structuring concept in that scheme is that of the genuine union between the divine existence of the infinite creator and human nature in Christ, a pattern replicated in the coming of the Holy Spirit as the inauguration of a second, strictly analogous union of God and humanity. The subtle way in which Schleiermacher conceives these unions in line with his rigorous understanding of radical causality of divine creation requires careful unpacking. Only such an analysis brings to light the architecture of the doctrine of the Trinity, and its function as a kind of meta-doctrine, connecting and coordinating different elements in the doctrine of grace. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die kurze Koda in Schleiermachers Der christliche Glaube , die die TrinitÃ¤t behandelt, beabsichtigt nicht, die Lehre zu marginalisieren. Sie deutet eher an, dass die Lehre, obwohl gegenwÃ¤rtig noch nicht vervollkommnet, die Rekapitulation des ganzen ErlÃ¶sungsschemas ist. Der strukturierende Zentralbegriff dieses Schemas ist die genuine Einigung des unendlichen Seins des SchÃ¶pfers mit der menschlichen Natur in Christus. Die Ankunft des Heiligen Geistes wiederholt dieses Muster, insofern sie die EinfÃ¼hrung einer zweiten, wenn auch analogen Einigung von Gottheit und Menschheit ist. Eine sorgfÃ¤ltige Analyse ist notwendig, um den raffinierten Zusammenhang zwischen diesem Einigungsbegriff und Schleiermachers striktem VerstÃ¤ndnis der radikalen KausalitÃ¤t der gÃ¶ttlichen SchÃ¶pfung zu beschreiben. Nur eine solche Analyse erklÃ¤rt den Aufbau der TrinitÃ¤tslehre und ihre Funktion als Metalehre, die die verschiedenen Bestandteile der Gnadenlehre Schleiermachers verknÃ¼pft und koordiniert.",2/1/22 21:45,,,,,,,"DeHart, Paul J.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1515/nzst.2010.003,7/1/10,2/1/22 21:45,2/1/22 21:45,"DeHart, Paul J.",,,Publisher: De Gruyter Section: Neue Zeitschrift fÃ¼r Systematische Theologie und Religionsphilosophie,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\LS24YUQZ\DeHart - 2010 - Ter mundus accipit infinitum The Dogmatic Coordin.pdf,,,,,1612-9520,,1,,,en,,,www-degruyter-com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,,,17-39,,,,,2010,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Ter mundus accipit infinitum,,,,http://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/nzst.2010.003/html,,52,,Q109417963,HINLQLC6,journalArticle,Ter mundus accipit infinitum: The Dogmatic Coordinates of Schleiermacher's Trinitarian Treatise,
"This study begins with an exegetical taxonomy of the different interpretations of the footwashing in modern Johannine literature and finds that the most overarching division that may be made in the ranks of its interpreters has to do with opposing views concerning the literary unity of the passage.  This study argues that two different literary strata may be observed and separated in the narrative: 13:1a, 4-5, 6-11 constitute the original version in the Gospel and present the washing as a sÄmeion of Jesus' glorification; vv. 1b-3, 12-20 represent a later insertion from the time of 1 John and present the washing as an example of humble behavior which is to be imitated.",,,,,,,,"Segovia, Fernando F.","Bible.

"This paper examines the parapraxes made by, to or about Jewish-identifi ed individuals discussed by Freud in Psychopathology of everyday life. Each of these errors and slips is occasioned by what he terms a âmÃ©sallianceâ between a Jew and a Gentile. Such incidents of distorted language betray unresolved ambivalences and unformulated anxieties endemic to Jewish-Gentile interaction in Freud's Vienna. First, the disturbed relationships between German-speaking Gentiles and their threatening DoppelgÃ¤nger, the Jews, are analyzed by means of Freud's analysis of the âuncannyâ and an examination of the particular restrictions placed upon the âoffi ciallyâ emancipated Jews in the Habsburg Empire, especially with regard to intermarriage. Then, the paper turns to Freud's discussions of explicitly Jewish-identifi ed individuals and their limitation to illustrating parapraxes associated with what should be the most pleasurable and intimate relationships between Jew and Gentile, namely sexual and connubial relations. His focus upon this confl icted conjunction diagnosed the intrinsically problematic character of Jew-Gentile interaction in his Vienna.",6/30/14 19:13,,,,,,,"Geller, Jay",Ethnicity; Sigmund Freud; (the) uncanny; Antisemitism; doppelgÃ¤nger (doubles; fin-de-siâcle vienna; identity (construction; jewishâgentile interaction; mÃ©salliances (intermarriage); parapraxes; psychopathology of everyday life,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1516/QDNQ-D1F4-99CE-JUEF,10/1/04,6/30/14 19:13,6/30/14 19:13,"Geller, Jay",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\66272MDB\abstract.html,,,,,1745-8315,,5,,,en,,,Wiley Online Library,,,,,,,,,1209-1223,,,,,2004,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The psychopathology of everyday Vienna,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/doi/10.1516/QDNQ-D1F4-99CE-JUEF/abstract,,85,,Q109417965,J2WFMFQ9,journalArticle,The psychopathology of everyday Vienna: Psychoanalysis and Freud's familiars,The International Journal of Psychoanalysis
"Prompted by the current debate and cognitive dissonance surrounding the #BlackLivesMatter protest campaignâs desired goals of securing freedom, justice, equality, and human dignity for people of African descent in the United States, this article addresses this social movement as an extension of Black humanism. This claim is a direct result of the #BlackLivesMatter movementâs sui generis origin and evolution beyond any identifiable Black religious institution. Robin D. G. Kelley reminds us that âinsisting that we are human and productive members of [American] society has been a first principle of Black abolitionist politics since at least the eighteenth century.â Thus it is important to recognize the contemporary significance of #BlackLivesMatter by placing it within a broader historical context that resonates with many tenets of the traditional Black freedom struggle yet also charts future directions, including nontheistic thought and praxis such as atheism, agnosticism, humanism, and other expressions of unbelief as part of the broader African American experience. In 2009, Pew Research Center data on religious pluralism in the United States revealed that more than 12 percent of African Americans nationwide readily self-identified as being unaffiliated with any particular religion. This group of Black nonbelievers constitutes the third largest cohort within African American religious lifeâa major development in the history of African American faith and culture that ought to be more fully explored and explained. Scholars have discussed the origins and varied nature of Black humanism at considerable length; this article builds upon that existing research by examining the origins and nature of Black humanism within the history of the Black freedom struggle.",2/13/18 22:26,,,,,,,"Floyd-Thomas, Juan",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.15367/kf.v4i1.140,5/19/17,2/13/18 22:26,2/13/18 22:26,"Floyd-Thomas, Juan Marcial",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\444N4W2P\Floyd-Thomas - 2017 - âA Relatively New Discovery in the Modern Westâ #.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\6CTGF6G8\140.html,,,,,2372-0751,,1,,,en,,,tupjournals.temple.edu,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2017,,,,,,Copyright (c) 2017 Kalfou,,,,,,,,,,,âA Relatively New Discovery in the Modern Westâ,,,,https://tupjournals.temple.edu/index.php/kalfou/article/view/140,,4,,Q109417966,URMYW99P,journalArticle,âA Relatively New Discovery in the Modern Westâ: #BlackLivesMatter and the Evolution of Black Humanism,Kalfou

"The essay examines the interrelationship of Jewish identification (self and/or ascribed) and the fashioning of human-horse hybrids in Primo Levi (""Quaestio de Centauris""), Bernard Malamud (""Talking Horse""), and Moacyr Scliar (The Centaur in the Garden). It begins its interrogation of the appeal of the centaur to several Jewish writers after the era of human-equine symbiosis ended by tracing how distinctions between horse and donkey as well as judgments of horsemanship had previously mediated gentile/Jewish difference. Then, while noting the possible influences of earlier Jewish literary constructions of Judentum- associated horses or horse-human hybrids on Levi, Malamud, and Scliar, the essay turns to their particular works. Mounted upon their respective human-horse hybrids, these three writers explore the supplemental character of Jewish identification in Western modernity, by which the dominant gentile society's ascribed Jewishness supplemented and often superseded the thus-identified individual's own diverse identifications. These writers examined this Jewish condition in relation to the modern Western (male) individual's experiences of doubleness, as well as to whether there was a place for any hybrid subject that may emerge out ofâand be distinct fromâthe identifications by which Jews were interpellated into or out of the ""human"" community.",5/14/20 20:55,,,,,,,"Geller, Jay",HORSEMANSHIP; HUMAN-animal relationships; INTERPERSONAL relations; JEWISH authors; MODERNITY,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.2979/prooftexts.37.2.02,2019-01,6/11/20 18:50,6/11/20 18:50,"Geller, Jay",,,Publisher: Indiana University Press,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\5R5N5CRN\Geller - 2019 - A Horse is a Horse, Of Course, Of Course, or Som.pdf",,,,,2729601,,2,,Prooftexts,,,,EBSCOhost,,,,,,,,,215-242,,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://proxy.library.vanderbilt.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rlh&AN=136244728&site=ehost-live&scope=site,,37,,Q109418033,TRJJ2WEH,journalArticle,"""A Horse is a Horse, Of Course, Of Course,"" or Some Nagging Suspicions about Some Jewish Writers",Prooftexts

"This article unearths and explores the implications of what appears to be the first review of Freud and Breuer's Studien uber Hysterie. This feuilleton by W appeared in the Wiener medizinischer Presse on 14 July 1895 -just over a week before Freud's âDream of Irma's Injectionâ. Connecting these events is a third item: a note entitled âEine Quelle des Antisemitismusâ apparently written by Freud during the 1890s. The note refers to an âIrmaâ who was raised in Hungary. Freud's only known patient who fits this criterion is Ilona Weiss, Elisabeth von R. in Studien. This article pursues the floating signifiers âIrmaâ and âWeissâ through a series of correlations and reconstructions of identities. First, combining the near coincidence of dream and review with her identification as Elisabeth von R. suggests that Ilona Weiss is part of the Sammelperson that is âIrmaâ. In addition, textual evidence leads to the conclusion that the essay's author is Heinrich Weiss, a Jewish neurologist and a respondent to Freud's âUb...",7/1/14 18:36,,,,,,,"Geller, Jay",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.3366/pah.2000.2.1.61,2/1/00,7/1/14 18:36,7/1/14 18:36,"Geller, Jay",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\K4SQA5D6\pah.2000.2.1.html,,,,,1460-8235,,1,,Psychoanalysis & History,,,,Edinburgh University Press Journals,,,,,,,,,61-75,,,,,2000,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Some More Additional âDay Residues',,,,http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/pah.2000.2.1.61,,2,,Q109418038,DBBR2IGU,journalArticle,"Some More Additional âDay Residues': The First Review of Studien Uber Hysterie, Ilona Weiss and the Dream of Irma's Injection",Psychoanalysis and History

"The article studies the relationship between the various representations of syphilis and that of the Jew from the 1880âs to the writing of Mein Kampf. It retraces the stages of an antisemitic discourse based on the image of blood. The Jewish dermatologists and bacteriologists finished by being identified with the didease on which they had started their research. The ritual of circumcision was itself moreover interpreted as a cause of syphilitic contamination. The effects of syphilis and of sexuality between the races were thus progressively linked. In the racist novel by Din-ter Sin Against Blood [Die SÃ¼nde wider das Blut], which was a great success at the end of the First World War, the stain of interracial relationship hit many generations and could not be removed. The assimilation of racial identity to morbid sexuality found its culmination in Hitlerian rhetoric.",7/1/14 18:41,,,,,,,"Geller, Jay",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.4000/rgi.562,1/10/96,7/1/14 18:41,7/1/14 18:41,"Geller, Jay",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\4IPH9C6D\Geller - 1996 - Le pÃ©chÃ© contre le sang  la syphilis et la constr.pdf; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\7CPDF986\562.html,,,,,1253-7837,,5,,,fr,,,rgi.revues.org,,,,,,,,,141-164,,,,,1996,,,,,,Tous droits rÃ©servÃ©s,,,,,,,,,,,Le pÃ©chÃ© contre le sang,,"Robatel, N.",,http://rgi.revues.org/562,,,,Q109418043,9QX3PJSJ,journalArticle,Le pÃ©chÃ© contre le sang : la syphilis et la construction de lâidentitÃ© juive,Revue germanique internationale

"Since his untimely death fifty years ago, there has been considerable cognitive dissonance surrounding Malcolm X in the collective consciousness. This tension is fueled by the way Malcolm X's life and legacy has been refracted through the prism of Christocentric analytic frameworks. A critical question is what corrective measures can be taken within Malcolm X studies to compensate for such methodological and theoretical biases and enable us to better understand his religious worldview within the context of his own complex subjectivity. This article explores three key areas of Malcolm X's life and legacy that are deeply significant for Christians and Christianity: the writing of The Autobiography of Malcolm X, the iconic use of Malcolm X's image, and Malcolm X's conversion to Sunni Islam following his pilgrimage to Mecca.",2/26/15 14:38,,,,,,,"Floyd-Thomas, Juan M.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.5325/jafrireli.3.1.0044,1/1/15,2/26/15 14:38,2/26/15 14:38,"Floyd-Thomas, Juan Marcial",,,,,,,,,2165-5405,,1,,Journal of Africana Religions,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,44-61,,,,,2015,,,,,,Copyright Â© 2015 Penn State University Press,,,,,,,,,,,Gaining One's Definition,,,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5325/jafrireli.3.1.0044,,3,,Q109418045,IT4KK6MT,journalArticle,Gaining One's Definition: The (De)Christianization of Malcolm X's Life and Legacy,Journal of Africana Religions
"Abstract Much of the research on African American adolescent sexual decision making has focused on teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases among poor or urban residents. Few studies consider the sexual profiles of middle-class African American female college freshmen from diverse locales. This study uses bivariate and logistic regression analyses to examine sexual behavior among ninety-one African American female freshmen attending college in the eastern and midwestern areas of the United States. Findings include detailed profiles of sexual behavior for this understudied population. Modeling results show that, although maternal sexual socialization does not influence whether respondents are virgins, sexually permissive views and practices such as heavy petting affect whether respondents are virgins. However, involvement in romantic relationships is the strongest predictor of sexual intercourse.",7/18/14 18:12,,,,,,,"Barnes, Sandra L.; Mia Smith Bynum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.5406/blacwomegendfami.4.2.0001,2010-10,7/18/14 18:12,6/16/21 19:18,"Barnes, Sandra L.",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\RA46MSZP\Barnes and Bynum - 2010 - An Examination of the Sexual Behavior of Middle-Cl.pdf,,,,,1935-2743,,2,,"Black Women, Gender + Families",,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,1-30,,,,,2010,,,,,,Copyright Â© 2010 University of Illinois Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/blacwomegendfami.4.2.0001,,4,,Q109418046,434J6ME2,journalArticle,An Examination of the Sexual Behavior of Middle-Class African American Female College Freshmen,"Black Women, Gender & Families"
"Black megachurches are increasingly known for their charismatic pastors, multiple worship services, and unconventional programs. But what are their stances on gender inclusivity? Informed by black liberation and womanist theologies, this mixedmethodological study across 16 black megachurches assesses clergy views on the subject as well as whether their congregations are welcoming and affirming, open, or exclusionary regarding black women in church roles. Results show that most black clergy in the study are open to black women's participation and leadership; black women hold a myriad of positions in both churches and in church-sponsored secular organizations. When constraints are placed on womanism, it is to encourage male leadership in familial and pastoral roles. In such scenarios, pastors tend to emphasize gender role complementarity rather than equality. However, pastors who most adamantly espouse black liberation and womanist tenets are most likely to be welcoming and affirming of black women's full participation without caveats to their involvement. Moreover, such churches tend to promote inclusivity of other historically oppressed groups such as sexual minorities and to encourage open discourses about controversial issues among adults and youth in general.",7/7/20 19:19,,JSTOR,,,,,"Barnes, Sandra L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.5406/womgenfamcol.3.2.0115,2015,7/7/20 19:19,7/7/20 19:19,"Barnes, Sandra L.",,,Publisher: University of Illinois Press,,,,,,2326-0939,,2,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,115-143,,,,,2015,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/womgenfamcol.3.2.0115,,3,,Q109418047,T4F43C2A,journalArticle,Black Megachurches and Gender Inclusivity,"Women, Gender, and Families of Color"

"This article employs an intersectional analysis of ethical discourse guiding the US context in the era of Trump. Illustrating the viability of intersectionality for the broader utility of Christian social ethics, this essay explores the contemporary development of surreality and sub-rosa morality indicative of the current political situation in the United States in the wake of Donald Trumpâs political ascendancy from the reality TV boardroom of The Apprentice to the Oval Office of the White House. Faced with the escalating nature of lies and deception emanating from the Trump administration, this article provides the moral rationale for civil disobedience as well as suggesting prescriptions for a redemptive ethic intended to remedy the legitimation crises which have become the defining ethos of our time.",6/30/21 16:18,,,,,,,"Floyd-Thomas, Stacey M.; Philosophy Documentation Center",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.5840/jsce201942210,2019,6/30/21 16:18,6/30/21 16:18,"Floyd-Thomas, Stacey",,,,,,,,,1540-7942,,1,,,,,,DOI.org (Crossref),,,,,,,,,3-20,,,,,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,âOh Say Can You See?,,,,http://www.pdcnet.org/oom/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=&rft.imuse_id=jsce_2019_0039_0001_0003_0020&svc_id=info:www.pdcnet.org/collection,,39,,Q109418054,VWNA6QMC,journalArticle,"âOh Say Can You See?â: Womanist Ethics, Sub-rosa Morality, and the Normative Gaze in a Trumped Era",Journal of the Society of Christian Ethics

"This paper argues that one receives the calling to become a therapist to experience feeling real. Stated differently, therapists become therapists to heal themselves. Drawing on object relations theory, the author identifies five ""wounds"" therapists may consciously and unconsciously address by entering a therapeutic profession. The wounds are located in the capacity to believe, the capacity to imagine, the capacity for concern, the capacity to be alone, and the capacity of object usage. Achieving these capacities provides the therapist with a sense of wholeness, health, and holiness.",,,,,,,,"Hamman, Jaco J.",Christopher Bollas; Object Relations Theory; Psychotherapists; Vocation/Calling; DW Winnicott; winnicott,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1023/A:1012516915840,2001,6/13/14 14:20,7/7/21 19:08,"Hamman, Jaco",,,,,,,,,0022-4197,,3,,,English,,,Primo,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2001,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The search to be real,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1012516915840,,40,,Q110550678,D7Z5GWM5,journalArticle,The search to be real: Why psychotherapists become therapists,Journal of Religion and Health
"Within the Judeo-Christian tradition, the scenario where a person, often a child, is being beaten by a parent, an authority figure, or even God, is often found. This essay searches for an explanation for this phenomenon by combining Sigmund Freud's thoughts on the masochism of the Oedipus complex and Martin Bergmann's belief that Western religion was impacted by the sadism of the Laius and Jocasta Complexes.

"On March 12, 2015, Rev. Creflo A. Dollar, a prominent televangelist and renowned mega church pastor, posted an online video soliciting charitable donations (âlove gift of any amountâ) from his followers and other potential donors in order to buy a Gulfstream G650 airplane worth an estimated $65 million. According to the video presentation on Creflo Dollar Ministries website (which was quietly removed from the website a few days later), the ministry currently owns a private jet that was built in 1984 and acquired by Rev. Dollar in 1999. On the video, a ministry spokesperson reported that the plane traveled at least 4 million miles but was no longer safe. On a recent trip overseas, the ministryâs website states, one of the engines failed while the plane was in midair. Despite the great peril, the pilot was able to land safely and none of the passengers aboard was injured. As a result of this mishap, Dollar and his team made this statement: [W]e are asking members, partners, and supporters of this ministry to assist us in acquiring a Gulfstream G650 airplane so that Pastors Creflo and Taffi [Dollar] and World Changers Church International can continue to blanket the globe with the Gospel of grace â¦ We are believing for 200,000 people to give contributions of 300 US dollars or more to turn this dream into a reality.

"""This is a creative scholarly argument revisiting the substance, understanding, and implications of the doctrine of creation ex nihilo for contemporary theology and philosophy. Paul DeHart examines the special mode of divine transcendence (God's infinity) and investigates areas where accepting an infinite God presents challenging questions to Christian theology. He discusses what would 'saving knowledge' or 'faith' have to look like when confronted by such an unlimited conceptions of deity, and ponders on how can the doctrine of God's trinity be brought into harmony with radical notions of transcendence; as well as whether the doctrine of creation itself is threatened when the conception of creator's mind is not maintained. DeHart engages with a quite diverse range of figures: Jean-Luc Marion, Schleiermacher, Kierkegaard, Kathryn Tanner, John Milbank and Rowan Williams, to illustrate his conviction. This volume deals with deep conceptual issues, indicating that creation ex nihilo remains a lively topic in contemporary theology""--",6/23/21 20:32,,,,,,,"DeHart, Paul J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,6/23/21 20:32,6/23/21 20:32,"DeHart, Paul J.",,,OCLC: 1226072805,,,,,978-0-567-69871-1 978-0-567-69873-5,,,,,,English,,,Open WorldCat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Creation and transcendence,,,,https://www.vlebooks.com/vleweb/product/openreader?id=none&isbn=9780567698711,,,,Q110920769,M9ESAL74,book,Creation and transcendence: theological essays on the divine sublime,

"""Just Traveling celebrates overcoming distance and seeking difference as defining human traits. Following the scriptural witness of God as the Earthroamer, the book explores the liminal qualities of traveling through six movements: anticipating, leaving, surrendering, meeting, caring, and returning. To travel is to move at the speed of being present to one's experiences, bridging distance and difference through acts of care. Drawing on personal experience as well as the wisdom of theology, anthropology, psychology, philosophy, and cultural studies, Hamman reimagines travel in a welcoming and beautiful yet also complex and troubled world. Whether leaving home serves our wanderlust and curiosity or has personal or spiritual purposes or whether we travel a few miles or cover vast distances, we travel best when we contribute to human flourishing. Care - the compassionate reaching out to someone or something - is the practice that allows one to travel differently. The spirituality of roads is filled with hopeful restorative potential, and life is best lived with the Earthroamer.""--Jacket",,,,,,,,"Hamman, Jaco J",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,6/29/22 18:28,6/29/22 18:28,"Hamman, Jaco",,,OCLC: 1250202837,,,,,978-1-5064-7206-5,,,,,,English,,,Open WorldCat,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Just traveling,,,,,,,,Q110920771,TS87ZKW2,book,"Just traveling: God, leaving home, and a spirituality for the road",

"""Richard Baxter's ecclesiology will be the focus of this study. Baxter (1615-1691) lived through the British Civil Wars, the Regicide, the Interregnum, the restoration of monarchy and episcopacy in 1660, subsequent ejection of numerous Puritan pastors, and the Glorious Revolution of 1689. His eccesiology was formed within these multifarious contexts. Among others, three significant facets of purity, unity, and liberty are examined in detail. This book re-examines the central role of catechizing and congregational discipline in Baxter's understanding of the true church, his insistence that the purity and unity of the church are to be pursued concurrently, the self-perceived identity of English Puritans, and the quesiton of the true church in the latter-half of the seventheenth century.""--Jacket.",,,,,,,,"Lim, Paul","Church; Author of The last century, 1615-1691; Bacster, Richard, 1615-1691; Bacter, Richard, 1615-1691; Bakster, Richard, 1615-1691; Baxter, Mr. (Richard), 1615-1691; Baxter, R.

"âPuritanâ was originally a term of contempt, and âPuritanismâ has often been stereotyped by critics and admirers alike. As a distinctive and particularly intense variety of early modern Reformed Protestantism, it was a product of acute tensions within the post-Reformation Church of England. But it was never monolithic or purely oppositional, and its impact reverberated far beyond seventeenth-century England and New England. This Companion broadens our understanding of Puritanism, showing how students and scholars might engage with it from new angles and uncover the surprising diversity that fermented beneath its surface. The book explores issues of gender, literature, politics and popular culture in addition to addressing the Puritansâ core concerns such as theology and devotional praxis, and coverage extends to Irish, Welsh, Scottish and European versions of Puritanism as well as to English and American practice. It challenges readers to re-evaluate this crucial tradition within its wider social, cultural, political and religious contexts.

"""Good advice that stands the test of time-those things we all know are true, tips that help us live the good life-we call wisdom. But, one life time is not enough to master the fine art of living. Distilled over centuries, the biblical book of Ecclesiastes offers us the time-tested advice of Israel's sages. This is the best of wisdom, with echoes of East and West-from Zen and Tao to Merton and Moore--all rolled into one. In Ecclesiastes, Bible scholar Choon-Leong Seow creatively translates and carefully interprets one of the world's most profound, most enduring collections of ancient wisdom. Sometimes joyful and exultant, other times cynical and fatalistic, the ancient author Qohelet (""Teacher"") wrestles with the ups and downs of real life. Even today, we recognize and repeat the sayings of this treasure-trove of apt advice. The book begins and ends with the infamous claim, ""Vanity of vanities, says Qohelet, vanity of vanities! All is vanity!"" In between, the sage leaves no stone unturned in the search for meaning. As the wisdom of biblical Ecclesiastes has stood the test of time, so shall Dr. Seow's Ecclesiastes become a classic in the venerated tradition of the Anchor Bible series""--Publisher description.",,,,,,,,"Seow, C.

"Preachers often feel stuck when met with quickly shifting and dense media topics that flood the headlines. If and when they determine it is appropriate to address issues that arise in the news cycle, they are often at a loss for how to speak about them from the pulpit. When preachers understand that a responsibility to sustain life is embedded in the purposes of preaching, they discover greater fluidity between the everyday world, the biblical text, and preaching itself.  <i>Preaching the Headlines</i>  reframes preaching as an ongoing conversation between the modern world and the world of the Bible, exploring where the divides between the two may be less rigid than we often acknowledge. The preacher uses what they know about life as a bridge to the text, while life in the text provides the bridge back to faith in the contemporary world. The goal of the book is to help preachers do theological reflection on the everyday world as an integral part of sermon development. The process offered in this book is not a substitute for basic methods of sermon development nor a model of exegesis for preaching. Preachers will use this process as a supplement alongside their current method of sermon preparation. Before the preacher can ever translate the meaning embedded in the headlines, they have to learn more about the topics they seek to preach about. They do this by digging behind the headlines and expanding their own resources beyond theological traditions alone. This work is done in order to think earnestly about how faith might spur transformative action in our world for more just ways of living together.",6/28/22 19:22,,,,,,,"THOMPSON, LISA L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,6/28/22 19:22,6/28/22 19:25,"Thompson, Lisa L.",,,DOI: 10.2307/j.ctvp7d5c9,,,,,978-1-5064-5386-6,,,,,,,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2021,1517 Media,,,,,,,,,,Working Preacher,,,,,,Preaching the Headlines,,,,http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctvp7d5c9,,6,,Q110920786,L25P8GPZ,book,Preaching the Headlines: Possibilities and Pitfalls,

"This is the first book to focus on the significance of religion during President Obama's years in the White House, both in the United States and internationally. Religion in the Age of Obama explores the religious and moral underpinning of the Obama presidency and of subsequent debates regarding his tenure in the White House. It provides an analysis of Obama's beliefs and their relationship to his vision of public life, as well as the way in which the general ethos of religion and non-religion has shifted over the past decade in the United States under his presidency. Including chapters from John L. Jackson Jr., Kathryn Lofton, Sylvester A. Johnson, Keri Day, and Max Perry Mueller, topics include how Obama has employed religious rhetoric in response to both international and domestic events, his attempt to inhabit a kind of Blackness that comforts and reassures rather than challenges White America, the limits of Christian hospitality within U.S. immigration policy, and the racialization of Islam in the U.S. national imagination. Drawing on a wide-range of topics, this book shows that the years of the Obama presidency served as a watershed moment of significant reorganization of the role of religion in national public life. Religion in the Age of Obama is an important and timely contribution to debates on religion, race, and public life in the United States.",,,,,,,,,"United States; Religion; 21st century; History; Obama, Barack; Religion and politics",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.5040/9781350041073,2018,6/11/20 18:48,7/21/20 16:09,"Floyd-Thomas, Juan Marcial",,"Floyd-Thomas, Juan Marcial; Pinn, Anthony B.",,,,,,978-1-350-04103-5,,,,,,eng,,,catalog.library.vanderbilt.edu,,,,,,,,,,"London, UK",,,,2018,BLoomsbury Publishing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q110920788,ACPIB2WK,book,Religion in the age of Obama,

"What are the spiritual consequences of abuse and trauma? Where is God? How and why does such senseless suffering occur? What is the relationship between loss and hope? What are the benefits of examining loss and hope from an interreligious focus? These are some of the questions addressed in this volume, written by leading international scholars and which also includes contributions by those who have suffered: survivors of genocide and state terror. Case studies of loss and hope from around the world are discussed, including from the United States, Ireland, Sri Lanka, India, Iran, Iraq, Argentina, China, and Chile. Religions examined include Buddhism, Islam, Christianity, Judaism and Hinduism.  Three interconnected lenses are used to explore new perspectives on loss and hope: survivors and victims' testimony; interfaith studies; and ethical approaches. The book highlights the need for responses to atrocity that transcend differences within gender, class, religion, race and ethnicity. The authors stress the need for partnership and dialogue from an interfaith perspective, and while neither hiding not unduly minimizing the extent of losses in the world, attempt to establish an ethics of hope in the face of destabilizing losses in the realms of human rights and post-conflict resolution.  Loss and Hope is the first book to bring together this high level and diversity of scholars living and working all over the world from different faith, cultural and ethnic backgrounds examining the universal themes of loss and hope.",6/26/18 17:19,,,,,,,"Rieger, Jeorg",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,7/7/14,6/26/18 17:19,6/26/18 17:23,"Rieger, Joerg",,"Admirand, Peter",,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\LNI7TAW4\loss-and-hope-9781472525413.html,,,,,,,,,,en,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2014,Bloomsbury Academic Publishing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/loss-and-hope-9781472525413/,,,,Q111089516,2M2P4TR5,bookSection,Losing Confidence in Free-Market Economics and Free-Market Religion: Recovering True Hope,"Loss and Hope: Global, Interreligious and Interdisciplinary Perspectives"

"This article describes the challenge of ""defining"" or ""conceiving"" a discipline that arose upon the request to edit a massive volume, The Wiley-Blackwell Companion to Practical Theology, as part of a series of Companions published by Wiley-Blackwell on key disciplines in religious and theological studies. It explores significant dynamics and interests behind the conceptualization and organization of the Companion and then addresses some of the benefits and limitations or growing edges, answering specific questions or concerns raised by three scholars in their papers presented at a symposium on the Companion at the University of Toronto in November 2012. The publication of the Companion to Practical Theology marks immense progress in the field in the last fifty years, making this an auspicious time for reassessment and reflection.",,,Scopus,,,,,"Miller-McLemore, B.J.",Theological education; Definition; Everyday faith; Method; Practical theology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1353/tjt.2013.0030,2013,11/28/22 18:03,11/28/22 18:03,"Miller-McLemore, Bonnie",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\I98QUXJU\display.html,,,,,1918-6371,,1,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,145-155,,,,,2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,The hubris and folly of defining a discipline,,,,,,29,,Q111725107,PNQWBHML,journalArticle,The hubris and folly of defining a discipline: Reflections on the evolution of the wiley-blackwell companion to practical theology,Toronto Journal of Theology

"According to historian Winthrop Hudson, âAll religious and ethnic groups reach a point in their historical development when they become self-conscious and look back on their origins as a means of defining their identity. Almost always the first step is an attempt to find their roots in an ancient lineage.â1 Whether we agree with E. Franklin Frazierâs argument that such a feat is hopeless for African Americans, due to our cultural amnesia caused by the ravages of the transatlantic slave trade, or whether we adopt Melville Herskovitzâs claim that we African Americans have, in fact, retained our African roots, even if only aesthetically, it is undeniable that the most knowable history of African Americans is rooted in the history and wisdom of the hush harbors and invisible institutions of that which has preserved and promoted the faith of Black people.2.

"The essays in this volume present the case for attending to the business aspects of religious activities in American religious history. Individual essays model useful approaches for pursuing these dimensions of religious organizations without neglecting their religious dimensions. Some of the essays are also models for critical inquiry into the sometimes self-serving compromises religious individuals and groups make with market capitalism in contemporary American life. The essay considers why previous theologically inclined scholars have neglected the kind of inquiry represented by the volume and celebrates the Business Turn as a ""Big Idea"" in the historiography of American religion worthy of emulation by other scholars interested in pursuing the nature of the American religious enterprise. By following flows of funds and bodies, watching who is raising money for what philanthropy, and how religious businessman and philanthropists justify themselves, the volume's authors upset common assumptions about American religion.

"Operating on the premise that our failure to recognize our interconnected relationship to the rest of the cosmos is the origin of planetary peril, this volume presents academic, activist, and artistic perspectives on how to inspire reflection and motivate action in order to construct alternative frameworks and establish novel solidarities for the sake of our planetary home.The selections in this volume explore ecologies of interdependence as a frame for religious, theological, and philosophical analysis and practice. Contributors examine questions of justice, climate change, race, class, gender, and coloniality and discuss alternative ways of engaging the world in all its biodiversity. Each essay, poem, reflection, and piece of art contributes to and reflects upon how to live out entangled differences toward positive global change.Constructive and practical, global and local, communal and personal, Ecological Solidarities is an innovative contribution to the discourses on relational and liberative thought and practice in religion, philosophy, and theology.

"This is the first book to provide an introduction to contemporary cultural approaches to the study of religion. This book makes sophisticated ideas accessible at an introductory level, and examines the analytic tools of scholars in religious studies, as well as in related disciplines that have shaped the field including anthropology, history, literature, and critical studies in race, sexuality, and gender. Each chapter is written by a leading scholar and includes: the biographical and historical context of each theorist -- Â· their approaches and key writings -- analysis and evaluation of each theory -- suggested further reading. Part One: Comparative Approaches considers how major features such as taboo, texts, myths and ritual work across religious traditions by exploring the work of Mary Douglas, Phyllis Trible, Wendy Doniger and Catherine Bell. Part Two: Examining Particularities analyzes the comparative approach through the work of Alice Walker, Charles Long and Caroline Walker Bynum, who all suggest that the specifics of race, body, place and time must be considered. Part Three: Expanding Boundaries examines Gloria AnzaldÃºa's language of religion, as well as the work of Judith Butler on performative, queer theories of religion, and concludes with Saba Mahmood, whose work considers postcolonial religious encounters, secularism, and the relationship between ""East"" and ""West.""

"""This volume draws together eleven essays by scholars of the Hebrew Bible, New Testament, Greco-Roman religion and early Judaism, to address the ways that conceptions of identity and otherness shape the interpretation of biblical and other religiously authoritative texts. The contributions explore how interpreters of scriptural texts regularly assume or assert an identification between their own communities and those described in the text, while ignoring the cultural, social, and religious differences between themselves and the text's earliest audiences. Comparing a range of examples, these essays address varying ways in which social identity has shaped the historical contexts, implied audiences, rhetorical shaping, redactional development, literary appropriation, and reception history of particular texts over time. Together, they open up new avenues for studying the relations between social identity, scriptural interpretation, and religious authority.""--",,,,,,,,Choon-Leong Seow,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2020,8/31/21 15:39,8/31/21 16:03,"Seow, C.L.",,"Brown, Ken; Joseph, Alison L; Breed, Brennan W",OCLC: 1201529271,,,,,978-0-567-68733-3,,,,,,English,,,Open WorldCat,,,,,,,,,169-195,,,,,2020,London: Bloomsbury T&T Clark,,,,,,,,,,Library of Hebrew Bible/Old Testament studies,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q111731400,XV7ETZ5F,bookSection,Perspectives on a Pluriform Classic,Reading other peoples' texts: social identity and the reception of authoritative traditions

"Evagrius of Pontus (ca. 345-399) was a Greek-speaking monastic thinker and Christian theologian whose works formed the basis for much later reflection on monastic practice and thought in the Christian Near East, in Byzantium, and in the Latin West. His innovative collections of short chapters meant for meditation, scriptural commentaries in the form of scholia, extended discourses, and letters were widely translated and copied. Condemned posthumously by two ecumenical councils as a heretic along with Origen and Didymus of Alexandria, he was revered among Christians to the east of the Byzantine Empire, in Syria and Armenia, while only some of his writings endured in the Latin and Greek churches. A student of the famed bishop-theologians Gregory of Nazianzus and Basil of Caesarea, Evagrius left the service of the urban church and settled in an Egyptian monastic compound. His teachers were veteran monks schooled in the tradition of Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Anthony, and he enriched their legacy with the experience of the desert and with insight drawn from the entire Greek philosophical tradition, from Plato and Aristotle through Iamblichus. <i>Evagrius and His Legacy</i>  brings together essays by eminent scholars who explore selected aspects of Evagrius's life and times and address his far-flung and controversial but long-lasting influence on Latin, Byzantine, and Syriac cultures in antiquity and the Middle Ages. Touching on points relevant to theology, philosophy, history, patristics, literary studies, and manuscript studies, <i>Evagrius and His Legacy</i>  is also intended to catalyze further study of Evagrius within as large a context as possible.",7/27/21 21:51,,,,,,,David A.

"Postcolonial biblical criticism enters the theoretical and methodological repertoire of the discipline in the latter half of the 1990s. Among critical approaches, therefore, it is of late vintage, marking the turn of the century â emerging, as it does, at the very end of the twentieth century and establishing a solid foothold only with the beginning of the twenty-first century. At first, it does so largely among critics fromthe non-Western world living and working in diaspora in the West and thus fitting the category of non-Western racialâethnic minorities within the West. Such critics come to biblical criticism after the fateful developments in the discipline of the 1970s, which involved not only fundamental changes in method and theory but also incipient transformations in visage and voice. Soon, however, postcolonial criticism would become a major area of interest for non-Western critics outside the West, similar newcomers to the discipline, as well as for Western critics. The present exposition of this still-developing critical approach proceeds in two steps. The first part offers an overview of the approach as a whole in terms of historical path, theoretical foundations, and methodological configuration. The second part examines its particular application to the Gospel of Matthew, beginning with an overview of postcolonial interpretations of the Gospel in general and concluding with postcolonial readings of Matthew 8:5â13 in particular, the episode traditionally known as âThe Healing of a Centurion's Servant.â Â© Cambridge University Press 2009 and 2010.",,,Scopus,,,,,"Segovia, F.F.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2009,11/28/22 19:38,11/28/22 19:38,"Segovia, Fernando F.",,,DOI: 10.1017/CBO9780511627118.009,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\H9K6Z2TL\display.html,,,,978-0-511-62711-8,,,,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,194-237,,,,,2009,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q111731407,3ESBLLVH,bookSection,Postcolonial criticism and the Gospel of Matthew,Methods for Matthew

"For Jacques Derrida, the notions and experiences of ""community,"" ""living,"" and ""together"" never ceased to harbor radical, in fact infinite interrogations. The oftenanguished question of how to ""live together"" moved Derrida throughout his oeuvre, animating his sustained reflections on hospitality, friendship, responsibility, justice, forgiveness, and mourning, as well as his interventions as an outspoken critic of South Africa's apartheid, the Israel/Palestine conflict, the bloody civil war in his native Algeria, human rights abuses, French immigration laws, the death penalty, and the ""war on terror."" ""Live together,"" Derrida wrote, ""one must . . . one cannot not 'live together,' even if one does not know how or with whom."" In this volume, the paradoxes, impossibilities, and singular chances that haunt the necessity of ""living together"" are evoked in Derrida's essay ""Avowing--The Impossible: 'Returns,' Repentance, and Reconciliation,"" around which the collection is gathered. Written by scholars in literary criticism, philosophy, legal studies, religious studies, Middle Eastern studies, and sociology working in North America, Europe, and the Middle East, the essays in this volume tackle issues such as the responsibilities and fragility of democracy; the pitfalls of decreed reconciliation; the re-legitimization of torture in the ""war on terror""; the connections between Orientalism, Semitism, and anti-Semitism; the delocalizing dynamics of globalization; crimes against humanity; nationalism; and politics as the art not of the possible but of the impossible. The volume includes analyses of current controversies and struggles. Here, Derrida is here read in and with regard to areas of intense political conflict--in particular, those that oppose Israelis and Palestinians, Hindus and Muslims, victims and perpetrators of South African apartheid, Turks and Armenians.The necessity of an infinitely patient reflection goes hand in hand with the obligation of justice as that which must not wait. It is in the spirit of such urgency, of a responsibility that cannot be postponed, that the essays in this volume engage with Derrida's thinking on ""living together.""",11/22/22 15:30,,,,,,,"Armour, Ellen",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013,11/22/22 15:30,11/22/22 15:32,"Armour, Ellen T.",,,,,,,,978-0-8232-4992-3,,,,,,English,,,JSTOR,,,,,,,,,123-136,,,,,2013,Fordham University Press,,,,,,,,,,,"Weber, Elisabeth",,,,,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt13x04js,,,,Q111731414,ERPSTH5X,bookSection,"Responsi/ability, after Derrida",Living Together: Jacques Derrida's Communities of Violence and Peace

"Over the course of the twentieth century the social process of suburbanization affected the practice of American religious life in ways both obvious and subtle. The translocation of where Americans worshipped transformed the way they worshipped. As pervasive as suburbs later became in American life, their emergence at the end of the nineteenth century owed to a confluence of factors that made these new communities a unique development in Western history. The word âsuburbanâ literally denotes being âbelow the city,â as in outside the citys walls and its protection. In traditional European civilization the suburbs were a residential location for the poor with inferior services. As a result of rapid late nineteenth-century improvements in communication and transportation, suburbs in the United States emerged as desirable residential enclaves connected to, but set apart from, more crowded and dirty cities. Since then suburbs in American life have been alternately viewed as refuges for the wealthy, signs of what is wrong with the culture at large, and, increasingly, simply the way Americans live. Suburbanization in the American context has been a social movement of both desire and necessity with far-reaching, often misunderstood ramifications for religion. The history of religion in suburbs is one of small beginnings in which suburban churches were, from the viewpoint of their denominations and sister churches in the cities, insignificant, and synagogues were virtually nonexistent. What began almost as an afterthought on the American religious landscape came to be one of religion's areas of greatest strength by the middle decades of the twentieth century.

"The noun tsara'at appears about two dozen times in the Hebrew Bible, almost exclusively in Leviticus, where it is used to describe a state of ritual defilement manifested as a scaly condition of the skin, a condition of cloth, leather, and the walls of houses. In the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible, negac tsara'at was translated as aphe lepras; in the Latin Vulgate, this became plega leprae. These words in Greek and Latin implied a condition that spread over the body, not a term of ritual impurity. Tsara'at has continued to be translated as ""leprosy,"" even though this term is not appropriate, as there was no leprosy as we know it in the Middle East during the time period the Hebrew Bible was written. Others have suggested that the proper translation of tsara'at is ""mold."" The recent identification of a specific mold (Stachybotrys sp.) that contaminates buildings and causes respiratory distress, memory loss, and rash, and the fact that mold has been present for millennia, lend support to the translation of tsara'at as ""mold.""",,,,,,,,"Sasson, Jack M.; Heller, Richard M.; Heller, Toni W.","Humans; Judaism; History, Ancient; Translating; Ancient Lands; Leprosy; Mycoses; Stachybotrys",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2003,12/15/14 17:44,10/7/20 15:14,"Sasson, Jack",,,PMID: 14593226,,,,,,0031-5982,,4,,Perspectives in Biology and Medicine,eng,,,NCBI PubMed,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14593226,,,,,,,,588-591,,,,,2003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Mold,,,,,,46,,Q28181268,Q925INFF,journalArticle,"Mold: ""tsara'at,"" Leviticus, and the history of a confusion",Perspectives in Biology and Medicine
"When the subject of the Black Church and homosexuality is broached, research often focuses on homophobia and correlates with HIV/AIDS. Fewer studies examine other problematic issues germane to gay and lesbian involvement in Black congregations. In this analysis, Black clergy dialogue during focus groups about inclusivity and church leadership by gays and lesbians. Informed by Cultural Theory, of equal interest is whether discourses are influenced by Black Church cultural tools, as well as cultural dynamics, from the broader Black community. As anticipated, findings suggest the tendency for clergy to promote welcoming church spaces, but to be reticent about affirming homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle. Furthermore, although clergy are generally supportive of involvement by closeted gays and lesbians as lay leaders, most do not support their involvement in the clergy, particularly as pastors. However, views vary based on denomination and gender, and are informed by Black Church cultural components such as scripture and the call-and-response tradition.",7/18/14 18:55,,,,,,,"Barnes, Sandra L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/00918369.2013.819204,2013,7/18/14 18:55,7/18/14 18:55,"Barnes, Sandra L.",,,PMID: 24059966,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\BIBI9PKN\00918369.2013.html,,,,,0091-8369,,10,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,,,,,,1409-1433,,,,,2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,To Welcome or Affirm,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00918369.2013.819204,,60,,Q43695207,STV3X2UI,journalArticle,"To Welcome or Affirm: Black Clergy Views About Homosexuality, Inclusivity, and Church Leadership",Journal of Homosexuality

"Young Black Men Who Have Sex With Men (BMSM) have been the subject of much research focused on health disparities in HIV occurrence, stigma, and mental health. Although such research is important, fewer studies focus on other equally salient areas of their lives such as spirituality, religious practices, and social support. Informed by literature on social support, this research endeavors to better understand these dynamics for a group of young BMSM who reside in a metropolitan city in Tennessee. Focus group results and content analysis uncover themes related to religion and resilience; queering Christianity; and virtual spirituality. Participants expressed an overarching need for support, safe spaces, genuine relationships, and godly instruction, conveyed through traditional Black Church involvement and nontraditional Internet usage. Findings are important for strategic, proactive, cross-generational collaboration with young BMSM to holistically meet their varied needs.

"This symposium examines how various discursive frameworks inform Jewish and non-Jewish interpretations of Jewishness. Although the specific characteristics of these frameworks are context-dependent, the underlying themes remain the same: Jewish identification entails identifying âdifference,â and this process of drawing distinctions between Jews and non-Jews gets developed in discursive frameworks of temporality, ârace thinking,â nationalism, and genetics, among others. In the broader contexts within which Jewish identification is formulated, these frameworks serve to: (i) delineate categories of people on the basis of socially salient qualities associated with human and other bodies; (ii) evaluate these categorical âtypesâ in regard to their determined âdesirableâ and âundesirableâ qualities; (iii) implement institutionally sanctioned measures that facilitate the privileging of the people who apparently embody desired qualities; and (iv) enforce structural constraints within which people may choose to contest, re-inscribe, re-appropriate, and/or attempt to transform components of the other three networks mentioned above. It also emphasizes the significance of who mobilizes these discourses, with what objectives in mind, and how both factors instantiate discursive and discursively informed concretized outcomes.",9/16/15 15:35,,,,,,,Jay Geller; Sarah Imhoff; Shana Sippy; Annalise E.

"Taking its lead from analyses of gift exchange by Marcel Mauss and Marshall Sahlins as well as of contact by Charles Long and Jonathan Z Smith, this article elaborates a theory of the exchange, among dominant social subjects, of representations of their subjected proximate others in order to rectify the crisis precipitated by contact with otherness that threatens their claims to autonomy, authority, homogeneity, and universality. Specifically it situates the polemical exchange of representations of women among Friedrich Schlegel (Lucinde/Lucinde), G W F Hegel (Antigone/Phenomenology of Spirit), and Karl Gutzkow (Wally/Wally the Skeptic) as exemplary German male bourgeois efforts to rectify the crises to subject formation generated, in part, by the emergence of gender-coded bifurcated bourgeois society and signaled by the Kantian and French Revolutions. The public dissemination of apotropaic representations screened the dependence upon proximate others by, and determined the positions among, exchange participants as well as maintained structures of domination.",6/27/14 19:39,,,,,,,"Geller, Jay",contact; G W F Hegel; gift exchange; other(s); representation,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/2050303213506474,12/1/13,6/27/14 19:39,6/27/14 19:39,"Geller, Jay",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\UQEN7SDS\293.html,,,,,"2050-3032, 2050-3040",,3,,Critical Research on Religion,en,,,crr.sagepub.com,,,,,,,,,293-307,,,,,2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,http://crr.sagepub.com/content/1/3/293,,1,,Q57661218,S5386EHW,journalArticle,"Gifting the other, or why are nineteenth-century German bourgeois men acting like Trobriand Islanders?",Critical Research on Religion

"This paper responds to three essays on historical-Jesus research which claim that an explicitly confessional Christian perspective need not compromise participation in historical research. Responding to Darrell Bock, it notes that evangelicals are new to embrace the methods associated with such study but questions whether this shift advances discussion. Responding to Craig Keener, it questions both the value of using biographies of Roman offi cials to determine the reliability of Gospel portraits and the use of data derived from late rabbinic sources to determine Second Temple practices. Responding to Robert Webb, it suggests that his 'methodological-naturalistic' view regarding causation of events will be most productive in conservative settings where there is no preliminary argument as to whether the events in question actually happened.",,,Scopus,,,,,"Levine, A.-J.",History; Ancient biography; Evangelicals; Historical Jesus; Memory; Oral tradition; Rabbinic sources,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1163/174551911X601153,2011,11/22/22 20:24,11/22/22 20:24,"Levine, Amy-Jill",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\E9SJAY84\display.html,,,,,1745-5197,,1,,,English,,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,96-106,,,,,2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Christian faith and the study of the historical Jesus,,,,,,9,,Q61000826,8RSQYYSU,journalArticle,"Christian faith and the study of the historical Jesus: A response to bock, Keener, and Webb",Journal for the Study of the Historical Jesus

"Roland Murphy's understanding of the Old Testament both on its own terms and as interpreted throughout the history of the Church provides a helpful complement to the Pontifical Biblical Institute's THE JEWISH PEOPLE AND THEIR SACRED SCRIPTURES IN THE CHRISTIAN BIBLE. This article expands on Murphy's own critique of the document (BTB 32.3 [2002]: 145-49) in its analysis of seven issues: contextual understanding, historical criticism, use of the Old Testament to interpret the New, Jewish interpretation, comparing Testaments, Formative Judaism, and the Shoah. It concludes that Murphy's ways of understanding the Old Testament provide helpful guides for correcting and improving the PBC document.",8/5/20 21:06,,,,,,,"Levine, Amy-Jill",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/014610790303300304,8/1/03,8/5/20 21:06,8/5/20 21:06,"Levine, Amy-Jill",,,Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd,"C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\5SR5ESZI\Levine - 2003 - Roland Murphy, The Pontifical Biblical Commission,.pdf",,,,,0146-1079,,3,,Biblical Theology Bulletin,,,,SAGE Journals,,,,,,,,,104-113,,,,,2003,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1177/014610790303300304,,33,,Q61000829,TR3AH8F7,journalArticle,"Roland Murphy, The Pontifical Biblical Commission, Jews, and the Bible",Biblical Theology Bulletin

"""To all who love the God with a 1000 names and respect scienceâ In the last quarter century, the academic field of Science and Theology (Religion) has attracted scholars from a wide variety of disciplines. The question is, which disciplines are attracted and what do these disciplines have to contribute to the debate? In order to answer this question, the encyclopedia maps the (self)-identified disciplines and religious traditions that participate or might come to participate in the Science and Religion debate. This is done by letting each representative of a discipline and tradition answer specific chosen questions. They also need to identify the discipline in relation to the Science and Religion debate. Understandably representatives of several disciplines and traditions answered in the negative to this question. Nevertheless, they can still be important for the debate; indeed, scholars and scientists who work in the field of Science and Theology (Religion) may need knowledge beyond their own specific discipline. Therefore the encyclopedia also includes what are called general entries. Such entries may explain specific theories, methods, and topics. The general aim is to provide a starting point for new lines of inquiry. It is an invitation for fresh perspectives on the possibilities for engagement between and across sciences (again which includes the social and human sciences) and religions and theology. This encyclopedia is a comprehensive reference work for scholars interested in the topic of âScience and Religion.â It covers the widest spectrum possible of academic disciplines and religious traditions worldwide, with the intent of laying bare similarities and differences that naturally emerge within and across disciplines and religions today. The AâZ format throughout affords easy and user-friendly access to relevant information. Additionally, a systematic question-answer format across all Sciences and Religions entries affords efficient identification of specific points of agreement, conflict, and disinterest across and between sciences and religions. The extensive cross-referencing between key words, phrases, and technical language used in the entries facilitates easy searches. We trust that all of the entries have something of value for any interested reader. Anne L.C.

"In recent years, sharp increases in the female prison population have landed more mothers behind bars. While the experiences of imprisoned women may differ substantially from free mothers, studies suggest that motherhood is important for many imprisoned mothers. The current study uses a sample of 210 imprisoned mothers and multivariate modeling to investigate how familial relationships before and during imprisonment and mothersâ postrelease expectations influence the salience of maternal identity. Findings suggest that regardless of demographic factors, close motherâcaregiver relationships, contact with family during imprisonment, and expecting to have custody of children upon release positively impacts imprisoned womenâs mothering identities.",7/18/14 18:53,,,,,,,"Barnes, Sandra L.; Stringer, Ebonie Cunningham",Women; Identity; Mothers; Criminology And Law Enforcement; family; prison,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/1557085113504450,2014,7/18/14 18:53,1/5/15 22:31,"Barnes, Sandra L.",,,,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\DFEM9TFC\29.html; C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\72D596CT\3.html,,,,,"1557-0851, 1557-086X",,1,,Feminist Criminology,en,,,fcx.sagepub.com,,,,,,,,,3-23,,,,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Is Motherhood Important?,,,,http://fcx.sagepub.com/content/9/1/3,,9,,Q63443869,HEHREDTU,journalArticle,Is Motherhood Important?

"In this essay, I explore the political significance of depression, particularly as a prominent form of resistance to conditions of life under contemporary global capitalism. After noting the political context of the second beatitude, which suggests a form of mourning that bears witness to public suffering, I assert that under the current dominance of the disease model, depression has lost its political voice. This loss is of grave concern given evidence that the culture of late capitalism (neoliberalism) has initiated a global epidemic of depression. I reframe depression as the final cry of souls diminished under these conditions. Finally, I denote the qualities of such souls, illustrating with a pastoral psychotherapy case summary. A dream presented during the termination phase not only provides a clinical presentation of the attributes of souls under neoliberal governance, but suggests how voice may ultimately be restored even when depression has become unconscious.",,,,,,,,"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",CAPITALISM; DOMINANCE (Psychology); MENTAL depression; MOURNING customs; NEOLIBERALISM; POLITICAL psychology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11089-013-0576-y,2014-08,12/10/14 23:04,12/10/14 23:04,"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",,,,,,,,,312789,,4,,Pastoral Psychology,,,,EBSCOhost,http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=rlh&AN=96774212&site=ehost-live&scope=cite,,,,,,,,503-522,,,,,2014,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Blessed Are Those Who Mourn,,,,,,63,,Q93432588,9PAHFJII,journalArticle,Blessed Are Those Who Mourn: Depression as Political Resistance,Pastoral Psychology

Intersex individuals are often told they are not human beings because they do not neatly fit into the categories of âfemaleâ and âmale.â Many are made to feel like monsters. Christianity enforces this model of sexual dimorphism with the notion that to be a human being means to be created clearly âfemaleâ or clearly âmaleâ in the image of God. This paper draws on interviews with German intersex Christians to explore their diverse images of God and what it means to be created in Godâs image with the goal of creating new âconditions of possibilityâ that represent the full range of human sex/gender.,4/1/20 21:24,,,,,,,"Budwey, Stephanie",images of God; Intersex; multiplicity; obscene Christs; sexual polymorphism,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,10.1080/13558358.2018.1463643,5/4/18,6/11/20 18:43,6/11/20 18:43,"Budwey, Stephanie A.",,,Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/13558358.2018.1463643,C:\Users\xus12\Zotero\storage\RUF9J8BR\13558358.2018.html,,,,,1355-8358,,2,,,,,,Taylor and Francis+NEJM,,,,,,,,,85-97,,,,,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,âGod is the creator of all life and the energy of this worldâ,,,,https://doi.org/10.1080/13558358.2018.1463643,,24,,Q94449528,MKRSMJ5T,journalArticle,âGod is the creator of all life and the energy of this worldâ: German intersex Christiansâ reflection on the image of God and being created in Godâs image,Theology & Sexuality

"Emerging from participant observation fieldwork in varied interfaith organizations, this essay argues that intentional interfaith engagement in the United States is a decidedly classed phenomenon that too rarely includes the presence and concerns of persons who are working poor. This dynamic is particularly problematic given religious entanglements with free-market capitalism and the specific political economic vulnerability and religious diversity of recent immigrants and refugees. Interfaith organizing models, especially with their inclusion of labor unions, offer an important balance in the ecology of interfaith engagement and resistance to the civil religion of neoliberalism. Through these place-based, consociational collaborations, labor organizations help faith communities historicize, conceptualize, and navigate complex economic dynamics while expanding labor's value-frameworks, forms of organizing, and apprehension of worker's faith-filled identities.",8/31/21 17:56,,,,,,,"Snarr, C.

"""On January 17, 1776, one week after Thomas Paine published his incendiary pamphlet Common Sense, Connecticut minister Samuel Sherwood preached an equally patriotic sermon. ""God Almighty, with all the powers of heaven, are on our side,"" Sherwood said, voicing a sacred justification for war that Americans would invoke repeatedly throughout the struggle for independence. In Sacred Scripture, Sacred War, James Byrd offers the first comprehensive analysis of how American revolutionaries defended their patriotic convictions through scripture. Byrd shows that the Bible was a key text of the American Revolution. Indeed, many colonists saw the Bible as primarily a book about war. They viewed God as not merely sanctioning violence but actively participating in combat, playing a decisive role on the battlefield. When war came, preachers and patriots alike turned to scripture not only for solace but for exhortations to fight. Such scripture helped amateur soldiers overcome their natural aversion to killing, conferred on those who died for the Revolution the halo of martyrdom, and gave Americans a sense of the divine providence of their cause. Many histories of the Revolution have noted the connection between religion and war, but Sacred Scripture, Sacred War is the first to provide a detailed analysis of specific biblical texts and how they were used, especially in making the patriotic case for war. Combing through more than 500 wartime sources, which include more than 17,000 biblical citations, Byrd shows precisely how the Bible shaped American war, and how war in turn shaped Americans' view of the Bible.""--Publisher description.",,,,,,,,"Byrd, James P.","Bible Teachings; Bible Theology; Biblical teachings; Teachings of the Bible; Theology, Biblical; United States Church history 18th century; United States History Revolution, 1775-1783 Religious aspects Christianity; War Biblical teaching; War Religious aspects Christianity",,BS680 .W2 B97 2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2013,5/1/14 21:49,5/1/14 21:49,"Byrd, James P",,,,,,,,978-0-19-984349-7,,,,,,eng,,,Primo,,,,,,243,,,,New York,,,,2013,Oxford University Press,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Sacred scripture, sacred war",,,,,,,,Q96154435,CXNWASTQ,book,"Sacred scripture, sacred war : the Bible and the American Revolution",

"James P. Byrd reminds us of the militaristic context in which Jonthan Edwards lived. Edwards himself was fully aware of the rivalry between Catholic France and Protestant England, and he saw the battles waged between these two powers on American soil as part of a larger cosmic struggle. What is sometimes forgotten, however, is that Edwards brought meaning to this setting by probing Scripture for what it had to say about war. Edwards preached a number of sermons on war during his lifetime, and from Scripture he found support for just wars and for the duty of citizens to serve in battle. By exploring Edwards' engagement with both the Old and New Testaments on war in his context, Byrd offers another angle on how Scripture shaped Edwards' life and thought, just as the issues of his day affected his reading of Scripture.

"In Edwards's thought, conversion was intimately connected to morality. Though the great moral philosophers of the Enlightenment claimed all people could be perfectly moral through their own efforts, for Edwards only the truly converted could be truly virtuous. Morality was closely related to spirituality. Only those with transformed affections could truly love as God loves. This intimate relationship between conversion and ethics then remained a persistent yet controversial theme in American theology. Historians recognize that successors of Edwards developed his ideas for benevolence in various directions, often agreeing but often departing from the ""letter"" of his ethical law to apply its ""spirit"" to urgent ethical issues. This chapter examines the connection between conversion and ethics in New England theology after Edwards, focusing specifically on case studies of slavery, war, and the biblical themes through which ministers envisioned these moral crises in relation to religious experience.

"Leading pastoral theologians explore a wide variety of themes related to pastoral practice. Pastoral Theology and Care: Critical Trajectories in Theory and Practice offers a collection of essays by leading pastoral theologians that represent emerging trajectories in the fields of pastoral theology and care. The topics explored include: qualitative research and ethnography, advances in neuroscience, care across pluralities and intersections in religion and spiritualties, the influence of neoliberal economics in socio-economic vulnerabilities, postcolonial theory and its implications, the intersections of race and religion in caring for black women, and the usefulness of intersectionality for pastoral practice. Each of the essays offers a richly illustrated review of a practice of pastoral care relationally and in the public domain. The contributions to this volume engage seven critical directions emerging in the literature of pastoral theology in the United States and internationally among pastoral and practical theologians. While coverage of these topics does not exhaust important points of activity in the field, it does represent especially promising resources for theory and practice. This important work:  Offers unique coverage of new directions in the field Includes contributions from an exceptional group of experts who are noted leaders in their areas of study Introduces the newest perspectives on pastoral care and offers constructive proposals  Filled with case illustrations that make chapters pedagogically useful, Pastoral Theology and Care is essential reading for faculty, seminarians and students in advanced degree programs, and pastors.",,,,,,,,"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,3/19/18,7/12/18 16:18,7/17/18 18:47,"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",1 edition,"Ramsay, Nancy J.",,,,,,978-1-119-29256-2,,,,,,English,,,Amazon,https://www.amazon.com/Pastoral-Theology-Care-Critical-Trajectories/dp/1119292565/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1531412228&sr=1-1&keywords=Pastoral+Theology++and++Care%3A++Critical++Trajectories++in++Theory++and++Practice,,,,,,,,,"Chichester, UK ; Hoboken, NJ",,,,2018,Wiley-Blackwell,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Q96198189,W6JLAXZN,bookSection,Class Power and Human Suffering: Resisting the Idolatry of the Market in Religious Practice and Pastoral Theology,Pastoral Theology and Care: Critical Trajectories in Theory and Practice
"This volume offers a detailed analysis of how the current phase of capitalism is eating away at social, interpersonal, and psychological health. Drawing upon an interdisciplinary body of research, Bruce Rogers-Vaughn describes an emerging form of human distresswhat he calls third order sufferingthat is rapidly becoming normative. Moreover, this new paradigm of affliction is increasingly entangled with already-existing genres of misery, such as sexism, racism, and class struggle, mutating their appearances and mystifying their intersections. Along the way, Rogers-Vaughn presents stimulating reflections on how widespread views regarding secularization and postmodernity may divert attention from contemporary capitalism as the material origin of these developments. Finally, he explores his own clinical practice, which yields clues for addressing the double unconsciousness of third order suffering and outlining a vision for caring for souls in these troubling times. .",,,,,,,,"Rogers-Vaughn, Bruce",Pastoral theology.
