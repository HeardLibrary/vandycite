55
Awakel ye men from dreams of Peace--
Nor sleep when danger's near.
But fling Old Glory to the breeze--
There are no cowards here!
Our fathers fought: like heroes died.
For years their blood they gave
That honor, home and Peace be ours:
Awake! Thy country savel
Our flag for honor ever stands
To lift the weak, to lead the free.
America, our blessed land.
Is calling, calling thee.
From North to South; from Sea to Sea.
I hear the answering ery:
Thy sons forever shall be free
For thee will live and dier
Then fling Old Glory to the main
Beneath her stars enroll,
For cowardice shall never stain
The glory of her folds
The Stars and Stripes shall lead us on
A mighty host for right-
That Peace shall reign forevermore
And war from Earth take flight.

The Y. M. C. A. Keeps the
Home Ties From Breaking
$35.000.000
John F.Buller
HINK what it means during the bitter, discomforting days
to have the Y. M. C. A. hut-a home where our boys can
safely spend the off-duty hours of temptation-a warm,
friendly social center where they can rest; write to loved
ones; play games; secure refreshments and necessities; read;
enjoy music, motion pictures and other entertainments;
and find in the secretary a Christian friend.
Our boys are out there ""somewhere"" ready to make the
supreme sacrifice for us. Will you sacrifice to help the
Y. M. C. A. maintain this home touch for them? They are
fighting for your freedom. Will you help fight for their
character?
The expense of conducting this work here and overseas is
enormous. At least $35,000,000 needed to carry it to July 1,
1918. $6,000 will provide a Hut in this country, $15,000 in
France. Perhaps you can furnish one or more. Surely you
can give something. National Campaign, November 11 to 19.
Many will give their lives
All can give their Money
""Money can be turned over to the Y.M.C.A. with every con-
fidence it will be expended scientifically and along lines
acceptable to the soldiers,"" writes U. S. Army General.
