    "To run this script, you need to first create an account on the OpenAI developer platform by going to <https://platform.openai.com/> and clicking on the `Sign up` button. As of 2024-02-07, the pricing is as follows: Charges per token (1000 tokens is roughly 750 words); $0.0005 per 1000 tokens for gpt3.5-turbo, new accounts start with a $5 credit (check your usage under profile page). This credit expires after a certain number of months, so don't sign up until you are actually ready to experiment. Once the credit runs out, you will need to add to your credit balance using a credit card. \n",
    "\n",
    "After creating your account, go to the [API keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) option and click `Create new secret key`. If you are working on your own computer, you can allow \"All\" permissions. You will have one opportunity to copy the secret key once it is generated, so be prepared to either save it in a text file or add it to the code below. Note the warning about hard-coding the key within this script!\n"
