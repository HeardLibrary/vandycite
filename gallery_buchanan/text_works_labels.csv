""how can it have happened?"" she asked fink over dinner at a place called barclay's on 8th street, where a meal was ninety cents rather than the sixty-five next door in the university inn. the village was stunned. she could feel it in the restaurant whose air seemed sucked out. the owner, who normally chummed with fink whose inside political information he profoundly respected, had only distantly nodded to them when they entered, as though at a funeral. with a wink and a canny grin, fink tapped the side of his nose, but she knew how raked his spirit was. ""don't worry, stalin knows what he's doing; and he's not helping hitler, he'll never supply germany."" ""but i think he is, isn't he?""
