“Kara Walker creates silhouette shadow-plays out of the gender and racial images that expressed and sustained the violence of African-American chattel-slavery. Because she uses an old-fashioned medium and childish stereotypes, Walker’s works have the air of being caught in a time-lag; these are images that persist longer in memory than the narratives that once gave them meaning.” Gregg Horrowitz",IN COPYRIGHT,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/26758483/representation-view

Beautiful and elegant, her silhouettes seduce with their simplicity and simultaneously highlight the way that stereotypes obscure complex histories. The Emancipation Approximation, a series of 27 screen prints, is an ironic interpretation of Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 that formally abolished slavery.

Although Walker’s complicated narratives defy definite interpretation, they deal with difficult and compelling social problems such as racism and sexism and can be shocking, disturbing, and to some, offensive. Her stories are open-ended, and force each viewer to interpret them based on his or her own history, personality, and prejudices. Tough and provocative, Walker’s art elicits contemplation of issues from America’s past and their legacies. (Albright Knox Art Gallery)",,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/26758631/representation-view

(Chauncey Lowe); Fan Zhang, graduate student intern, summer 2003, indicated that it is carved with a Tang dynasty style, but is not sure of its origin (it might be from another Asian country such as Japan or Thailand). He also thought that if we identify the origin of the stone, it might shed light on it's country of origin and when it was made.
Stone was identified as argillite in April 2007. Comparison with similar types of Buddhist sculptures indicate this head could be from northern China, from the Northern Qi or Tang Dynasty (Jin Weinuo, Ancient Chinese Buddhist Sculpture, 2002 - Arts Ov NB1912 .B83 J564 2002), but could be as late as Ming b/c of curls. Is a similar head of the Buddha in the Sackler Gallery.

Minku Kim thinks that the areas of plaster may be left from a time when the sculpture would have been painted (4/2/2015)",NO KNOWN COPYRIGHT,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/26758789/representation-view

In Latin, the word lera means the ridge left by ploughing. The verb de-lerare means to make an irregular ridge when ploughing. A delirius was one who could not make a straight line furrow when ploughing and thus came to mean a crazy disoriented person.

During the Civil War telegraph lines were often strung in the vineyards among the grapes and vines to disguise their location. The popular phrase, ‘I heard you through the grapevine’ was developed from this practice of passing news from one location to another.

Stay Alert (Matauri Bay, New Zealand) 1995-2005 
In the 1600’s, before the days of radar, the only way to know if the enemy was coming was to actually see him. Highest ground being the best vantage point and the highest ground usually meant a steep hill. Erta is the rather obsolete Italian word for hill. The cry, ‘Stai all’erta!’, was a cry to a man in the hills. Over time the English language absorbed the Italian word and ‘to the hill’ became a slightly less urgent warning to be alert.

Windfall (Czech-Republic) 1996 
Unexpected good fortune has been called windfall for almost nine centuries. An ancient law, dating as far back as 1100, prohibited all commoners from cutting down trees but allowed the gathering of wood that had fallen from the wind. 
There is also another accepted version of the origin of the word beginning with a charcoal burner named Purkiss. Purkiss found the body of William Rufus, King of England, who had been killed by an archer in Hampshire’s New Forest. He carted the kings body back to Winchester and was rewarded with permission to gather all the firewood he needed that could be found on the ground. 900 years have passed and the Purkiss family still live in the New Forest, which is the largest surviving medieval forest thanks to this and similar laws.

Shore/Coast (Varigotti, Italy) 2004

Inscription indicates piece was published by William Hogarth's wife, Jane in 1781; possibly printed posthumously from plates dated around 1750. Hogarth died in 1764. Jane was bequeathed all his plates; her copyright in the engravings was extended by special Act of Parliament; and she continued printing his works for many years. Golden Head in Leicester Fields was one of two homes belonging to Jane and William Hogarth. It's more likely that she published the work of other artists, such as this etching, as it bears little resemblance to the art of William Hogarth.",,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/26759712/representation-view

This work is a still from a large-scale video installation of the same title, with the latter originally commissioned for the 2007 Venice Biennale. The installation was first shown in the fifteenth-century Church of the Oratorio San Gallo, a short distance from the Piazza San Marco. Inspired by the writings of Senegalese poet Birago Diop, it takes its title from Andalusian Sufi mystic Ibn Arabi, who wrote, “The Self is an ocean without a shore. Gazing upon it has no beginning or end, in this world and the next.”

""This print was created for Artists For Victory, a World War II era artist's association. Its members lent their talents to designing posters and works of art that were put on display in patriotic exhibitions. This work shows a specific event in the early days of World War II. On September 3, 1939, just hours after Britain declared war on Germany, a German submarine sank the S.S. Athenia, a British passenger vessel bound for Canada, mistaking her for an armed merchant cruiser. There were many Americans aboard, some of whom lost their lives. The United States did not enter the war until December, 1941, the year this print was made. Lawrence Wilbur looked back to this event as an example of tragedies that had already occurred, to stir American sentiment against the German forces that had fired on an unarmed ship.""

Dr. Headrick has three theories about these figures.  1) They had household contexts based on a female religion.  2) They were toys.  Many times they are found in refuse.  They are cheap and disposable objects, so it makes sense that they were toys. 3)  They were planted in fields for fertility based crop rituals.  This would explain the obvious female anatomy on most of the figures including swollen breasts and belly (relating to childbirth), clearly articulated vulva, and emphasized hair.

Dr. Headrick has three theories about these figures.  1) They had household contexts based on a female religion.  2) They were toys.  Many times they are found in refuse.  They are cheap and disposable objects, so it makes sense that they were toys. 3)  They were planted in fields for fertility based crop rituals.  This would explain the obvious female anatomy on most of the figures including swollen breasts and belly (relating to childbirth), clearly articulated vulva, and emphasized hair.

Dr. Headrick is unsure that this is actually a stamp.  The surface of the object is not regularly smooth as a stamp would normally be.  Also, stamps of this type were hollow with holes on both ends since they were typically placed on a long stick to apply pigment to the body.  This object only has a hole on one end.

The stirrup-spout vessel--so named for the similarity of the spout form to that of a riding saddle stirrup--was a much-favored bottle shape in Precolumbian Peru. It has been suggested that the peculiarity of the double-branch/single-spout shape was to prevent evaporation of the liquids it contained.

Early in the first millennium B.C., the stirrup-spout bottle was elaborated into sculptural depictions of a wide range of visual phenomena.

The canvas appears to have been stained to appear older than it is. It is stretched on a stretcher of a type which was first patented in the U.S. in 1885; it seems unlikely that Dupre would have had access to it before his death, and equally unlikely that he would have used a stretcher in an English, rather than metric, measurement. The paint layers also show remarkably little crackle, although this is not unheard of if it has been kept in a stable environment.

REPRODUCTIONS

From translation found in book:
""This book is one of a series of twelve. It covers only the Tan'e period of the Tokaugawa era (Hoei to Horeki, 60 years.) The paintings (ed. note: prints) are by the following artists: Kiyonobu Torii, Tabishige Kaigetsudō, Anchi Chiyodo, and Masanobu Okamura. Paintings have been arranged by the year in which they were done in order to demonstrate changes in styles.

According to a translated table of contents the artists are as follows
1-8 Kiyonobu Torii, 9 and 10 Tabishige Kaigetsudō, 11 Anchi Choyodo, 12-20 Masanobu Okumura
Text includes an explanation of the Tan'e Period of Yamato Nishike, including brief biographies of the four artists with a discussion of the two major schools of the period, Torii and the Kaigetsudō; an exposition of the techniques used in producing these twenty prints; and acknowledgements.",,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/26757897/representation-view

Following notes taken from Michael Quick, author of George Inness, A Catalogue Raisonne in an interview with Art Curator Joseph Mella, Spring, 1995.  The catalogue, at the time of this interview, was in preparation. This painting is a field study or sketch, and is very unusual since few have survived from this period (1860s). (A number have survived from the 1870s while Inness was in Italy.) Regarding dating...the work displays techniques that were evident in the 1860s, i.e. brown underpaint, modeling of black and grey. The tree on the right is a motif Inness used in the early 1860s.  Letters survive dated 1868 from Leeds.

The first to take the name Colonna (“de Columna”) was Piero, the son of Gregorio, Count of Tusculum, who on Gregorio’s death (c. 1064) received the castle of Colonna in the Alban Hills, together with Palestrina and other places, as his share of the inheritance. Like other Roman families, the Colonna gained power and wealth through papal favour and by the 13th century were already providing cardinals and senators of Rome. Thereafter, the Colonna were consistently prominent in the politics of the church and the city of Rome. (""Colonna Family."" Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online Academic Edition.

Most of kuchi-e prints were illustrations of bijin and continued the tradition of idealized beauties in Japanese art. The subjects, however, have a decidedly Meiji era feel about them and reflect the artistic movement towards more western design.

The name of Rashomon came from the legend of Watanabe Notsuna, a samurai in Heian Period (794-1185). People compared the plumped flowers of Japanese wood mint to the arm of an oni (demon) cut down by Watanabe at Rashomon, the south gate of the city Heian-kyo (present-day Kyoto). Shichirinsou, also called Sakurasou (桜草) is a species of primrose that is unique to East Asia. It is said to be a farewell gift to someone that you might never see again.

Notes on iconography from the ""Alumnus"" article by Ljubica Popovitch: 
Top row: three images of the Virgin Mary (actually three separate icons), kneeling in the top middle is a secular figure, probably the donor of the icon (v. rare in a portable icon. This and his ornate clothing signify his prominence, likely as a landowner or boyar)
Middle row (L to R): a middle-aged saint, a young saint, two hermits. Wearing secular clothing, but the weapons they carry signify they are Holy Warriors
Bottom row (L to R): Two holy physicians (denoted by symbols of the profession; they may be portraits), a bearded hermit/holy abbot in the center, all others are saints of various professions and physical types. 
Individual figures on sides: L is archangel Gabriel. On R is female saint, St. Agafia.",,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/26754298/representation-view

This painting of a mother and her child was originally of beautifully fresh colors, but the canvas required relining. The reliner instead of overseeing the work delegated it to an ignorant workman who used hot glue and so destroyed this picture. The painter who endeavored to restore it is of a different temperament from the unknown original artist. Instead of blending his objects he strongly individualizes them. Therefore he painted the child as such an outstanding figure that there were two dominant points. In order to regain a little of the original balance of the composition it has been necessary to subdue the impression of the child by putting a heavy coating of darkened varnish over him. THe varnish had better not be cleaned off but if the varnish ever be cleaned the painting should be revarnished in the same way if it be desired to retain a semblance of the original design and composition. Personally I ahve taken the trouble because the original painting was beautiful.

Upon inspection of the painting, Salort-Pons, curator DIA suggested that this work might be by Andrea Del Sarto, however it could be fake. If it's fake, then what is underneath it?

There were 100 justified and signed prints in this series, but there were others of the same print without consistent signatures or justifications (example, with the signature H-t-g, or without any signature).

The “Fingerie” refered to the publishing company, Kunstverlag Fingerle, Essilingen, which originally published the prints.

A pupil of HENRY MOORE at the Royal College, London, Piper embraced MODERNISM in the 1930s, producing geometric abstracts related to BEN NICHOLSON, a fellow member of the 7 & 5 Society (1919–35). However in his work as a WAR ARTIST (1940–2) he revealed his innate Romanticism in a series of dramatic wash drawings of devastated buildings. He continued to produce architectural drawings and prints after the war, the finest being those of Renishaw Hall (1941; Renishaw, Sitwell Coll.). Piper was also an accomplished stage and stained-glass designer (1962; Coventry Cathedral).",,https://forum.jstor.org/assets/26754972/representation-view
